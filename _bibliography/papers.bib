  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	url = {https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/479033/},
	abstract = {This thesis is the first study to investigate how the strategic competition over innovative technologies between the United States and China shapes the emergence of the quantum internet. A quantum internet will connect first-generation quantum computers over secure quantum channels to provide and distribute at scale a new type of compute resource that promises better security and a significant speedup of compute power. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The US and China consider emerging technologies in general, and quantum internet technologies in particular, of utmost importance in their efforts to contain their strategic rival. This thesis investigates how the quantum internet is being framed in security terms in this aggravating rivalry, and what this means for the future of the internet. As warnings of the dangers of a fragmented internet increase, the thesis maps out the significant obstacles on the way to maintaining interoperability.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}In an original contribution to research methods, this thesis is the first application of ERGMs to the analysis of patent data and their citation trees in the domain of quantum internet technologies. It conducts a statistical analysis of 4,200 patent family records and the 10,000+ patents they cite. Following a mixed-method approach, this thesis also evaluates a corpus of interviews with GCHQ, the British government and several internet governance and China experts. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}It finds robust evidence for two separate and siloed quantum research programmes in the US and China. These programmes are further characterised internally by significant homophily and the preferential treatment of domestic industries. Findings further suggest a tentative edge for China in the domain of quantum communication, an important technology for realising the quantum internet. China's significant progress in developing components for a quantum internet is found to have great potential to give its increasingly assertive stance on internet governance additional momentum.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The thesis argues that China should be expected to try and offer what may be called 'quantum patronage': a complete package of quantum technology stacks and appropriate standards in line with its recent 'China Standards 2035' plan. Quantum patronage may offer hitherto non-aligned countries critical technologies to secure their communication and build up quantum compute resources in exchange for a commitment to allegiance and strategic alignment.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The empirical findings of this thesis inform the building blocks of a coalitional game theory model of standards-finding for the quantum internet. It recommends the US make side payments to China as compensation for easing its strategic ambitions, in particular around its `New IP' many-nets proposal. The model is a first step towards designing a mechanism for finding a global standard for the future quantum internet. If the fragmentation of the quantum internet is to be avoided, the US and its allies should be prepared to incur new and unexpected political and financial costs to ensure long-term interoperability. Given the empirical evidence that this thesis presents, which points towards fragmentation, this could be a price worth paying for an open quantum internet.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}},

Recent works on collective intentionality and norm-following neglect the question how free agents can be brought to collectively intend to x, although x is not in their own interest. By arguing for a natural disposition to empathic understanding and drawing on recent research in the neurosciences, this article outlines an ontological framework that extends collective intentionality to questions of oppression and status asymmetries. In a contribution to this journal, Wisnewski (2005) unfortunately mischaracterizes the problem of meaning in social criticism. Implementing status problems in studies of collective intentions and construing social facts as both subjective and objective in character helps explain why agents can have persistent “misunderstandings” of social objects.},

Particular emphasis is placed on Adorno's notion of the potential of a sociological approach that is more suitable for gaining insight into the antagonistic capitalist condition. The key components of such an approach, notably experience, its interplay with theory, and sociology's response to appearance, are further illuminated with reference to passages that illustrate their operations in sociological research.},

We present a team game-theoretical framework in which players can switch between two kinds of reasoning: an individual mode in which stakeholders aim for the best possible outcome for themselves and a “we-mode” in which they are genuinely concerned with finding a standard that is optimal for the whole group. We show that a higher inclination towards “we-mode” reasoning is beneficial overall and maximizes individual payoffs and the outcome for the entire group. We argue that cooperation is therefore in the rational self-interest of stakeholders; it is not just desirable from a vague moral perspective. We conclude that in a world where national regulatory frameworks are losing their grip, only norms that have been worked out by a sufficiently large number of “we-reasoning” stakeholders can be called legitimate.},
