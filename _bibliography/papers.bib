  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	abstract = {This article responds to recent debates in critical algorithm studies about the significance of the term “algorithm.” Where some have suggested that critical scholars should align their use of the term with its common definition in professional computer science, I argue that we should instead approach algorithms as “multiples”—unstable objects that are enacted through the varied practices that people use to engage with them, including the practices of “outsider” researchers. This approach builds on the work of Laura Devendorf, Elizabeth Goodman, and Annemarie Mol. Different ways of enacting algorithms foreground certain issues while occluding others: computer scientists enact algorithms as conceptual objects indifferent to implementation details, while calls for accountability enact algorithms as closed boxes to be opened. I propose that critical researchers might seek to enact algorithms ethnographically, seeing them as heterogeneous and diffuse sociotechnical systems, rather than rigidly constrained and procedural formulas. To do so, I suggest thinking of algorithms not “in” culture, as the event occasioning this essay was titled, but “as” culture: part of broad patterns of meaning and practice that can be engaged with empirically. I offer a set of practical tactics for the ethnographic enactment of algorithmic systems, which do not depend on pinning down a singular “algorithm” or achieving “access,” but which rather work from the partial and mobile position of an outsider.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of digital data reflecting economic and human development, and in particular the availability of data emitted as a by-product of people’s use of technological devices and services, has both political and practical implications for the way people are seen and treated by the state and by the private sector. Yet the data revolution is so far primarily a technical one: the power of data to sort, categorise and intervene has not yet been explicitly connected to a social justice agenda by the agencies and authorities involved. Meanwhile, although data-driven discrimination is advancing at a similar pace to data processing technologies, awareness and mechanisms for combating it are not. This paper posits that just as an idea of justice is needed in order to establish the rule of law, an idea of data justice – fairness in the way people are made visible, represented and treated as a result of their production of digital data – is necessary to determine ethical paths through a datafying world. Bringing together the emerging scholarly perspectives on this topic, I propose three pillars as the basis of a notion of international data justice: (in)visibility, (dis)engagement with technology and antidiscrimination. These pillars integrate positive with negative rights and freedoms, and by doing so challenge both the basis of current data protection regulations and the growing assumption that being visible through the data we emit is part of the contemporary social contract.},

Without even knowing it, we use public-key cryptography to transmit secret information like credit card numbers; and we use digital signatures to verify the identity of the websites we visit. How do our computers perform these tasks with such ease?  This is the first book to answer that question in language anyone can understand, revealing the extraordinary ideas that power our PCs, laptops, and smartphones. Using vivid examples, John MacCormick explains the fundamental "tricks" behind nine types of computer algorithms, including artificial intelligence (where we learn about the "nearest neighbor trick" and "twenty questions trick"), Google's famous PageRank algorithm (which uses the "random surfer trick"), data compression, error correction, and much more. These revolutionary algorithms have changed our world: this book unlocks their secrets, and lays bare the incredible ideas that our computers use every day.},

Practice requires value judgments: What should be done? Who should do it? Who should pay for it? How much? Balancing scientific opportunities with societal needs depends on appreciating both the promises and the ambiguities of science. Understanding practice informs discussions about how to manage research integrity, conflict of interest, and the challenge of modern genetics to human research ethics. Society cannot have the benefits of research without the risks. The last chapter contrasts the practices of science and religion as reflective of two different types of faith and describes a holistic framework within which they dynamically interact.},

Traditionally, suicide was thought to be a matter of purely individual despair but Durkheim recognized that the phenomenon had a social dimension. He believed that if anything can explain how individuals relate to society, then it is suicide: Why does it happen? What goes wrong? Why do certain social, religious or racial groups have higher incidences of suicide than others? As Durkheim explored these questions he became convinced that abnormally high or low levels of social integration lead to an increased likelihood of suicide. On Suicide was the result of his extensive research. Divided into three parts - individual reasons for suicide, social forms of suicide and the relation of suicide to society as a whole - Durkheim's revelations have fascinated, challenged and informed readers for over a century.},

	abstract = {What is capitalism? How do we understand its relation to twenty–first century society? What does it mean to criticize capitalism? And what kinds of social conflict and struggle can we expect to find under capitalism? In this important new book, Nancy Fraser and Rahel Jaeggi take a fresh look at the big questions surrounding this peculiar social form known as "capitalism," upending many of our commonly held assumptions about what capitalism is and how to subject it to critique. Jaeggi presses Fraser to develop her new, "expanded" view of capitalism, in which capitalism is more than an economic system but an "institutionalized social order" that encompasses multiple domains of society – including the state monopoly on violence, the organization of family life, and relations to the natural environment. Fraser shows how, throughout its history, various regimes of capitalism have relied on a series of institutional separations between economy and polity, production and social reproduction, and human and non–human nature, periodically readjusting the "boundaries" between these domains in response to crises and upheavals. Fraser and Jaeggi discuss in what sense such "boundary struggles" offer a key to understanding capitalism′s contradictions and the multiple forms of conflict to which it gives rise. What emerges from this analysis is a renewed crisis critique of capitalism which puts our present conjuncture into broader perspective, along with sharp diagnoses of the weaknesses of contemporary progressive politics, the recent resurgence of right–wing populism, and what would be required of a viable left alternative. This major new book by two leading critical theorists will be of great interest to anyone concerned with the nature and future of capitalism and with the key questions of progressive politics today.},

	abstract = {This book represents a major step forward in the use of economic sociology to illuminate the nature and workings of capitalism amid the far-reaching changes of the contemporary era of global capitalism. For the past twenty years economic sociologists have focused on mesa-level phenomena of networks, but they have done relatively little to analyze capitalism as an overall system or to show how such phenomena emerge from and shape the dynamics of capitalism. The Economic Sociology of Capitalism seeks to change this, by presenting both big-picture analyses of capitalism and more focused pieces on institutions crucial to capitalism. The book, which includes sixteen chapters by leading scholars in economic sociology, is organized around three broad themes. The first section addresses core issues and problems in the new study of capitalism; the second considers a variety of topics concerning America, the leading capitalist economy of the world; and the third focuses attention on the question of convergence stemming from the global transformation of capitalism and the challenge of explaining institutional change. The contributions, which follow a foreword by economic historian Avner Greif and the editor's introduction, are by Mitchel Abolafia, James Baron and Michael Hannan, Mary C. Brinton, John Campbell, Gerald Davis and Christopher Marquis, Paul DiMaggio and Joseph Cohen, Peter Evans, Neil Fligstein, John Freeman, Francis Fukuyama, Ko Kuwabara, Victor Nee, Douglass C.

	shorttitle = {Realism and {Social} {Theory}},
	abstract = {The failure of social philosophers to make sense of an object of knowledge that embodies real divisions and polarities has generated a fundamental problem of social theory: the fallacy of reductive-conflationary analytical and explanatory models in sociological research. This book seeks to define the problem of sociology as one of developing appropriate theoretical and methodological tools for describing and analysing a multi-faceted social reality.   Through an extensive critical review of the major traditions of social theory from the perspective of social realism, this book develops the argument that social theory to date has been hamstrung by its resort to conflationary-reductive analytical modes. Part I presents a realist critique of the traditional rivals of holism and individualism while Part II offers a realist critique of the major paradigms of sociological elisionism. In Part III the author builds on these critiques by exploring how the ontology of social realism can sustain a robust social theory that resolves the traditional dilemmas and antinomies.   Deploying this social realism as a tool of explanatory critique of influential sociological theories of contemporary society, such as risk, liquid modernity, reflexive modernity, and postmodernity, this book is essential reading for students and scholars of critical theory, critical realism, philosophy and sociology.},

Using a critical realist version of the theory of emergence, Dave Elder-Vass argues that, instead of ascribing causal significance to an abstract notion of social structure or a monolithic concept of society, we must recognise that it is specific groups of people that have social structural power. Some of these groups are entities with emergent causal powers, distinct from those of human individuals. Yet these powers also depend on the contributions of human individuals, and this book examines the mechanisms through which interactions between human individuals generate the causal powers of some types of social structures. The Causal Power of Social Structures makes particularly important contributions to the theory of human agency and to our understanding of normative institutions.},

Social influence network theory advances a dynamic social cognition mechanism, in which individuals are weighing and combining their own and others' positions on an issue in the revision of their own positions. The influence network construct of the theory is the social structure of the endogenous interpersonal influences that are involved in this mechanism. With this theory, the authors seek to lay the foundation for a better formal integration of classical and current lines of work on small groups in psychological and sociological social psychology.},

This book draws on the tools of science and technology studies and economic sociology to reconceptualize the intersection of economy and technology, suggesting materiality--the idea that social existence involves not only actors and social relations but also objects--as the theoretical point of convergence. The contributors take up general concerns, such as individual agency in a network economy and the materiality of the household in economic history, as well as specific financial technologies such as the stock ticker, the trading room, and the telephone. Forms of infrastructure--accounting, global configurations of trading and information technologies, and patent law--are examined. Case studies of the impact of the Internet and information technology on consumption (e-commerce), the reputation economy (the rise of online reviews of products), and organizational settings (outsourcing of an IT system) round off this collection of essays.ContributorsElizabeth Popp Berman, Daniel Beunza, Michel Callon, Karin Knorr Cetina, Shay David, Thomas F.

The need to cultivate and enlist the public’s trust in the abilities of particular scientists and scientific institutions constitutes one of this book’s major themes. The advent of the Internet, the mass digitization of research information, and social media brought about, among many other things, the ability to harvest – sometimes implicitly – a wealth of human genomic, biological, behavioral, economic, political, and social data for the purposes of scientific research as well as commerce, government affairs, and social interaction. What type of ethical dilemmas did such changes generate? How should scientists collect, manipulate, and disseminate this information? The effects of this revolution and its ethical implications are wide-ranging. This book includes the opinions of myriad investigators, practitioners, and stakeholders in big data on human beings who also routinely reflect on the privacy and ethical issues of this phenomenon. Dedicated to the practice of ethical reasoning and reflection in action, the book offers a range of observations, lessons learned, reasoning tools, and suggestions for institutional practice to promote responsible big data research on human affairs. It caters to a broad audience of educators, researchers, and practitioners. Educators can use the volume in courses related to big data handling and processing. Researchers can use it for designing new methods of collecting, processing, and disseminating big data, whether in raw form or as analysis results. Lastly, practitioners can use it to steer future tools or procedures for handling big data. As this topic represents an area of great interest that still remains largely undeveloped, this book is sure to attract significant interest by filling an obvious gap in currently available literature.},

Using a wide range of case studies and source material to illustrate the dilemmas and resolutions that an ethnographic researcher may encounter, this textbook guides the reader from the initial design and planning stages through to the analysis and writing-up. It explores the historical and philosophical foundations of ethnographic research and goes on to cover a range of relevant topics such as participant observation, qualitative interviews, (focus) group interviews and visual data collection and analysis. Having been substantially revised and updated, the second edition includes new discussions of emerging practices such as reflexive ethnography and autoethnographic accounts, as well as an entire chapter dedicated to new directions in the field – including virtual, mobile, multi-sited and global ethnography.},

The chapters concentrate on the real-time, moment-by-moment nature of interview management and interaction. A key feature of the book is the inclusion of reflexive vignettes that foreground the voices and experience of qualitative researchers (both novices and more expert practitioners). The vignettes demonstrate the importance of reflecting on and learning from interactional experience. In addition, the book provides an overview of different types of interviews, commenting on the orientation and make-up of each type. Overall, this book encourages reflective thinking about the use of research interviews. It distinguishes between reflection, reflective practice and reflexivity. All the chapters focus on recurring choices, dilemmas and puzzles; offering advice in opening out and engaging with these aspects of the research interview.},

	abstract = {The second edition of a comprehensive state-of-the-art graduate level text on microeconometric methods, substantially revised and updated.The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content, the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis. Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of "generalized instrumental variables" (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the "generalized estimating equation" literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain "obvious" procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.},

	address = {Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA},
	title = {Essays in {Computing} {Science}},
	isbn = {978-0-13-284027-9},
	abstract = {Charles Antony Richard Hoare is one of the most productive and prolific computer scientists. This volume contains a selection of his published papers. There is a need, as in a Shakespearian Chorus, to offer some apology for what the book manifestly fails to achieve. It is not a complete 'collected works'. Selection between papers of this quality is not easy and, given the book's already considerable size, some difficult decisions as to what to omit have had to be made. Pity the editor weighing the choice between a seminal paper, perhaps widely republished, and a lesser known gem overtaken by subsequent developments. The only defence that can be offered is to reassure the reader that Tony Hoare was consulted. The paper published as Chapter 1 is so placed because it provides biographical context. With this exception, the papers appear in chronological order of main publication. Each paper is introduced by 'link material'. Here again, there is need (at least) for explanation: how can one embellish such papers? The idea behind the link material is to record things which could not have been written in the original paper. Sometimes, it is possible to explain better the context in which a paper was conceived; the subsequent development of the ideas introduced can only be written with hindsight. Apart from these inputs, the papers speak so well for themselves that it has been possible to keep the link material brief. Because the editor's text varies in length, the (abstract and) paper follow immediately rather than being laid out on separate pages. In order to avoid confusion, the link material is set in a smaller fount. Again to assuage the reader's doubts, Hoare does have the last word in the Postscript. An attempt has been made to trace some of the key dates of drafts, submissions, etc. leading up to publication. For a scientist who points out that 'writing the paper is my method of research' this is both necessary and difficult. Some of Hoare's papers go through many drafts which are circulated to colleagues (sometimes changing title, sometimes using the same title on a complete rewrite.) A complete historiography has not been attempted. In particular, many of Hoare's papers have been reprinted (sometimes in several places): normally, only the first source is given. With some caution, Hoare's work can be divided under a number of headings. These themes are not disjoint, the whole output comes from a single person. Hoare's work on language definition is seen in Chapters 3, 13, 14, 16 (and also, to a lesser extent, in Chapters 11, 12); his contribution to methods of reasoning about programs is covered in Chapters 4-6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20; his seminal work on parallelism can be traced through Chapters 10, 12, 15-17. Amidst writing these, often difficult, papers Hoare has produced a number of articles aimed at a wider audience: here, Chapters 1, 2, 7, 18, 21, 22 represent this form of his writing. The papers themselves have all been re-typeset and only minimal changes have been made. The form of references to other publications has been made uniform and all references have been collected at the end of this volume. In order to provide a useful snapshot, all papers by Hoare (even if there are co-authors) have been gathered into a separate list of references. (Except where they are referred to, Technical Reports etc. are not included: only true 'publications' are listed.) The form of reference to these is '[72]' or 'Hoare([72] )', the list being ordered, and numbers accordingly assigned, on a chronological basis. (This results in the use of 'Hoare' as a key even where the article lists a co-author before Hoare. No disrespect to his erstwhile colleagues is intended.) The other list of references gives works to which Hoare has not contributed. It is listed alphabetically, and references take the form 'Dijksta (1976)', with a, b etc. to distinguish publications in the same year. The editor and the publishers acknowledge, with thanks, permission to reprint the copyrighted articles in this book that have been published in various journals, proceedings, and books. Individual credits, with details of the sources of the papers, are given as a footnote to each chapter opening. The task of editing these essays has been most rewarding. The fact that it did not become a burden is largely thanks to the support I have received. I should like to thank Julie Hibbs who has typed and controlled the evolving book; Alison McCauley undertook all of the bibliographic research with real enthusiasm. Thanks are also due to the staff at Prentice Hall International who provided enormous support and encouragement. I am also very grateful to those other computer scientists who have offered advice and/or references. In particular I should like to thank John Reynolds, Jim Horning, Bob Tennant, Brian Randell, David Gries, and Jim King. Finally, I should like to thank Tony Hoare, with whom co-operation is always so stimulating.},

It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as "Big Data" has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning -- the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge -- has also advanced. In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications.Alpaydin offers an account of how digital technology advanced from number-crunching mainframes to mobile devices, putting today's machine learning boom in context. He describes the basics of machine learning and some applications; the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances, with such applications as customer segmentation and learning recommendations; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns act so as to maximize reward and minimize penalty. Alpaydin then considers some future directions for machine learning and the new field of "data science," and discusses the ethical and legal implications for data privacy and security.},

	abstract = {Big data is a term used for very large data sets that have more varied and complex structure. These characteristics usually correlate with additional difficulties in storing, analyzing and applying further procedures or extracting results. Big data analytics is the term used to describe the process of researching massive amounts of complex data in order to reveal hidden patterns or identify secret correlations. However, there is an obvious contradiction between the security and privacy of big data and the widespread use of big data. This paper focuses on privacy and security concerns in big data, differentiates between privacy and security and privacy requirements in big data. This paper covers uses of privacy by taking existing methods such as HybrEx, k-anonymity, T-closeness and L-diversity and its implementation in business. There have been a number of privacy-preserving mechanisms developed for privacy protection at different stages (for example, data generation, data storage, and data processing) of a big data life cycle. The goal of this paper is to provide a major review of the privacy preservation mechanisms in big data and present the challenges for existing mechanisms. This paper also presents recent techniques of privacy preserving in big data like hiding a needle in a haystack, identity based anonymization, differential privacy, privacy-preserving big data publishing and fast anonymization of big data streams. This paper refer privacy and security aspects healthcare in big data. Comparative study between various recent techniques of big data privacy is also done as well.},

	abstract = {Research methods are essential parts in conducting any research project. Although they have been theorized and summarized based on best practices, every field of science requires an adaptation of the overall approaches to perform research activities. In addition, any specific research needs a particular adjustment to the generalized approach and specializing them to suit the project in hand. However, unlike most well-established science disciplines, computing research is not supported by well-defined, globally accepted methods. This is because of its infancy and ambiguity in its definition, on one hand, and its extensive coverage and overlap with other fields, on the other hand. This article discusses the research methods in science and engineering in general and in computing in particular. It shows that despite several special parameters that make research in computing rather unique, it still follows the same steps that any other scientific research would do. The article also shows the particularities that researchers need to consider when they conduct research in this field.},

The author outlines the cultural and historical context in which Simmel worked; reviews Simmel's most important writings; and examines his legacy to sociology by illuminating his links with Weber's theories and his influential relationship with Marxism.Simmel, a central figure in the development of modern sociology, and a contemporary of Weber and Durkheim, was one of the first to identify sociology as a separate discipline. His ideas influenced Weber, the Chicago School, and many later sociologists. His introduction of a number of basic concepts to sociology, such as exchange, interaction and differentiation, attest to his intellectual stature and the far-reaching significance of his work.},

	abstract = {We perform decoy-state quantum key distribution between a low-Earth-orbit satellite and multiple ground stations located in Xinglong, Nanshan, and Graz, which establish satellite-to-ground secure keys with ∼kHz rate per passage of the satellite Micius over a ground station. The satellite thus establishes a secure key between itself and, say, Xinglong, and another key between itself and, say, Graz. Then, upon request from the ground command, Micius acts as a trusted relay. It performs bitwise exclusive or operations between the two keys and relays the result to one of the ground stations. That way, a secret key is created between China and Europe at locations separated by 7600 km on Earth. These keys are then used for intercontinental quantum-secured communication. This was, on the one hand, the transmission of images in a one-time pad configuration from China to Austria as well as from Austria to China. Also, a video conference was performed between the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which also included a 280 km optical ground connection between Xinglong and Beijing. Our work clearly confirms the Micius satellite as a robust platform for quantum key distribution with different ground stations on Earth, and points towards an efficient solution for an ultralong-distance global quantum network.},

We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary. Our method provides a way of exploring many-body phenomena on a programmable quantum simulator and could enable realizations of new quantum algorithms.},

	abstract = {Meeting the Universe Halfway is an ambitious book with far-reaching implications for numerous fields in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. In this volume, Karen Barad, theoretical physicist and feminist theorist, elaborates her theory of agential realism. Offering an account of the world as a whole rather than as composed of separate natural and social realms, agential realism is at once a new epistemology, ontology, and ethics. The starting point for Barad’s analysis is the philosophical framework of quantum physicist Niels Bohr. Barad extends and partially revises Bohr’s philosophical views in light of current scholarship in physics, science studies, and the philosophy of science as well as feminist, poststructuralist, and other critical social theories. In the process, she significantly reworks understandings of space, time, matter, causality, agency, subjectivity, and objectivity.In an agential realist account, the world is made of entanglements of “social” and “natural” agencies, where the distinction between the two emerges out of specific intra-actions. Intra-activity is an inexhaustible dynamism that configures and reconfigures relations of space-time-matter. In explaining intra-activity, Barad reveals questions about how nature and culture interact and change over time to be fundamentally misguided. And she reframes understanding of the nature of scientific and political practices and their “interrelationship.” Thus she pays particular attention to the responsible practice of science, and she emphasizes changes in the understanding of political practices, critically reworking Judith Butler’s influential theory of performativity. Finally, Barad uses agential realism to produce a new interpretation of quantum physics, demonstrating that agential realism is more than a means of reflecting on science; it can be used to actually do science.},

	abstract = {This article is an account of the dynamics of interaction across the social sciences and neurosciences. Against an arid rhetoric of ‘interdisciplinarity’, it calls for a more expansive imaginary of what experiment – as practice and ethos – might offer in this space. Arguing that opportunities for collaboration between social scientists and neuroscientists need to be taken seriously, the article situates itself against existing conceptualizations of these dynamics, grouping them under three rubrics: ‘critique’, ‘ebullience’ and ‘interaction’. Despite their differences, each insists on a distinction between sociocultural and neurobiological knowledge, or does not show how a more entangled field might be realized. The article links this absence to the ‘regime of the inter-’, an ethic of interdisciplinarity that guides interaction between disciplines on the understanding of their pre-existing separateness. The argument of the paper is thus twofold: (1) that, contra the ‘regime of the inter-’, it is no longer practicable to maintain a hygienic separation between sociocultural webs and neurobiological architecture; (2) that the cognitive neuroscientific experiment, as a space of epistemological and ontological excess, offers an opportunity to researchers, from all disciplines, to explore and register this realization.},

Questioning the traditional idea of mind over matter, as well as discussing the danger of setting up a false distinction between the two, this book makes for an invaluable addition within cultural theory and the recent turn to affect.   In a powerful and engaging matter, Blackman discusses the immaterial body across the neurosciences, physiology, media and cultural studies, body studies, artwork, performance, psychology and psychoanalysis.

	abstract = {Background
Overviews of methods are potentially useful means to increase clarity and enhance collective understanding of specific methods topics that may be characterized by ambiguity, inconsistency, or a lack of comprehensiveness. This type of review represents a distinct literature synthesis method, although to date, its methodology remains relatively undeveloped despite several aspects that demand unique review procedures. The purpose of this paper is to initiate discussion about what a rigorous systematic approach to reviews of methods, referred to here as systematic methods overviews, might look like by providing tentative suggestions for approaching specific challenges likely to be encountered. The guidance offered here was derived from experience conducting a systematic methods overview on the topic of sampling in qualitative research.

Results
The guidance is organized into several principles that highlight specific objectives for this type of review given the common challenges that must be overcome to achieve them. Optional strategies for achieving each principle are also proposed, along with discussion of how they were successfully implemented in the overview on sampling. We describe seven paired principles and strategies that address the following aspects: delimiting the initial set of publications to consider, searching beyond standard bibliographic databases, searching without the availability of relevant metadata, selecting publications on purposeful conceptual grounds, defining concepts and other information to abstract iteratively, accounting for inconsistent terminology used to describe specific methods topics, and generating rigorous verifiable analytic interpretations. Since a broad aim in systematic methods overviews is to describe and interpret the relevant literature in qualitative terms, we suggest that iterative decision making at various stages of the review process, and a rigorous qualitative approach to analysis are necessary features of this review type.

Conclusions
We believe that the principles and strategies provided here will be useful to anyone choosing to undertake a systematic methods overview. This paper represents an initial effort to promote high quality critical evaluations of the literature regarding problematic methods topics, which have the potential to promote clearer, shared understandings, and accelerate advances in research methods. Further work is warranted to develop more definitive guidance.

It is a passionate but realistic manifesto for those wishing to undertake the craft of ethnography and to do it well. All who read it will benefit."  - Sam Hillyard, Durham University   This major book from one of the world’s foremost authorities recaptures the classic inspirations of ethnographic fieldwork in sociology and anthropology, reflecting on decades of methodological development and empirical research. It is part manifesto, part guidance on the appropriate focus of the ethnographic gaze.  Throughout Atkinson insists that ethnographic research must be faithful to the intrinsic and complex organization of everyday life. An attempt to rescue ethnography from contemporary ‘qualitative’ research, the book is a corrective to the corrosive effects of postmodernism on the analysis of social organization and social action. Atkinson affirms the value of fieldwork, while incorporating contemporary perspectives on social analysis.

The key to a successful quantum internet will be the ability to generate robust entanglement between distant quantum memories. Unavoidable interactions with the environment, however, generally result in the loss of entanglement. Kalb et al. describe an entanglement distillation protocol that could be used to enhance the purity and robustness of entanglement between quantum nodes of a primitive quantum network.
Science, this issue p. 928
The impact of future quantum networks hinges on high-quality quantum entanglement shared between network nodes. Unavoidable imperfections necessitate a means to improve remote entanglement by local quantum operations. We realize entanglement distillation on a quantum network primitive of distant electron-nuclear two-qubit nodes. The heralded generation of two copies of a remote entangled state is demonstrated through single-photon–mediated entangling of the electrons and robust storage in the nuclear spins. After applying local two-qubit gates, single-shot measurements herald the distillation of an entangled state with increased fidelity that is available for further use. The key combination of generating, storing, and processing entangled states should enable the exploration of multiparticle entanglement on an extended quantum network.
A distillation protocol is developed that enhances entanglement between distant nodes of a quantum network.

	abstract = {Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum mechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle introduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by motivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with simple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small fraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic quantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and quantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the simplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch's algorithm. Our presentation demands neither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.},

	abstract = {Richard Feynman’s observation that certain quantum mechanical effects cannot be
simulated efficiently on a computer led to speculation that computation in general could
be done more efficiently if it used these quantum effects. This speculation proved
justified when Peter Shor described a polynomial time quantum algorithm for factoring
integers.
In quantum systems, the computational space increases exponentially with the size
of the system, which enables exponential parallelism. This parallelism could lead to
exponentially faster quantum algorithms than possible classically. The catch is that
accessing the results, which requires measurement, proves tricky and requires new
nontraditional programming techniques.
The aim of this paper is to guide computer scientists through the barriers that
separate quantum computing from conventional computing. We introduce basic
principles of quantum mechanics to explain where the power of quantum computers
comes from and why it is difficult to harness. We describe quantum cryptography,
teleportation, and dense coding. Various approaches to exploiting the power of quantum
parallelism are explained. We conclude with a discussion of quantum error correction.},

This book covers all the topics that are typically presented in a standard upper-level course in quantum mechanics, but its teaching approach is new. Rather than organizing his book according to the historical development of the field and jumping into a mathematical discussion of wave mechanics, Townsend begins his book with the quantum mechanics of spin. Thus, the first five chapters of the book succeed in laying out the fundamentals of quantum mechanics with little or no wave mechanics, so the physics is not obscured by mathematics. Starting with spin systems it gives students straightfoward examples of the structure of quantum mechanics. When wave mechanics is introduced later, students should perceive it correctly as only one aspect of quantum mechanics and not the core of the subject.},

	abstract = {Computer technology pervades almost every aspect of our life: from the cars that we drive, to the mobile phones that we use to communicate; from the digital cameras that capture images of the world around us, to the laser printers that turn image into picture. Yet at the heart of these enabling technologies lie fundamental components and systems, without the understanding of which such technologies would never have been developed. Principles of Computer Hardware explores the fundamentals of computer structure, architecture, and programming that underpin the array of computerized technologies around which our lives are now built. The book opens with an introduction to the fundamental concepts upon which computers are constructed - gates, circuits, logic - and computer arithmetic, the 'language' through which computers communicate. It then reveals how computers are structured and how they operate, taking us step-wise from the instruction set architecture, the bringing together of instructions through assembly language programming, and on to the heart of the computer, the central processing unit. The book then builds on these foundations to consider how the hardware interfaces with its surroundings, introducing us to topics such as computer memory; operating systems and the interface between hardware and software; and computer peripherals and computer communications - the interface with the outside world. Always putting educational value first, Principles of Computer Hardware uses the 68K processor as a powerful teaching and learning tool, putting substance firmly before style. With the clarity of explanation and captivating style for which Alan Clements is renowned, the book draws the student in to the heart of the subject, to foster an in-depth understanding from which more specialised study can then extend. The learning experience is enriched still further with a free CD-ROM, providing resources to enable students to engage with the subject in a hands-on manner: · A Windows-based simulator for the student to explore the design of digital circuits · Windows and DOS-based 68K simulators for students to investigate the operation of the 68K processor · An ARM simulator for students to write programs for a RISC processor, and run them on a PC Online Resource Centre:For lecturers (password protected): · Figures from the book available to download, to facilitate lecture preparation · Solutions to problems featured in the book, to aid formative learning · Multiple choice question test bank, to facilitate assessment of students' learning},

	abstract = {“Moore’s Law” in the semiconductor manufacturing industry is used to describe the predictable historical evolution of a single manufacturing technology platform that has been continuously reducing the costs of fabricating electronic circuits since the mid-1960s. Some features of its future evolution were first correctly predicted by Gordon E. Moore in 1965, and Moore’s Law became an industry synonym for continuous, periodic reduction in both size and cost for electronic circuit elements. This paper develops develops some stylized economic facts, reviewing why and how this progression in manufacturing technology delivered a 20 to 30 percent annual decline in the cost of manufacturing a transistor, on average, as long as it continued. Other characteristics associated with smaller feature sizes would be expected to have additional economic value, and historical trends for these characteristics are reviewed. Lower manufacturing costs alone pose no special challenges for price and innovation measurement, but these other benefits do, and motivate quality adjustment methods when semiconductor product prices are measured. Empirical evidence of recent changes to the historical Moore’s Law trajectory is analyzed, and shows a slowdown in Moore’s Law as measured by prices for the highest volume products: memory chips, custom chip designs outsourced to dedicated contract manufacturers (foundries), and Intel microprocessors. Evidence to the contrary, which relates primarily to Intel microprocessors is reviewed, as are economic reasons why Intel microprocessor prices might behave differently from prices for other types of semiconductor chips. A computer architecture textbook model of how chip characteristics affect microprocessor performance is specified and tested in a structural econometric model of microprocessor computing performance. This simple econometric model, using only a small set of explanatory chip characteristics, explains 99\% of variance across processor models in performance on commonly used performance benchmarks. This small set of characteristics should clearly be included in any hedonic model of computer or processor prices. Most of these chip characteristics also affect chip production cost, and therefore have an additional rationale for inclusion in a hedonic model that is separate from their demand-side effects on computer performance metrics relevant to users.},

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

Entanglement is revealed using single-photon detectors in which a single photon triggers an avalanche current. The resulting signal is then processed and stored in a computer. Here, we propose an approach to get rid of all the electronic devices between the photons and the experimentalist i.e. to use the experimentalist's eye to detect entanglement. We show in particular, that the micro entanglement that is produced by sending a single photon into a beam-splitter can be detected with the eye using the magnifying glass of a displacement in phase space. The feasibility study convincingly demonstrates the possibility to realize the first experiment where entanglement is observed with the eye.},

	abstract = {Bell’s theorem states that some predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be reproduced by a local-realist theory. That conflict is expressed by Bell’s inequality, which is usually derived under the assumption that there are no statistical correlations between the choices of measurement settings and anything else that can causally affect the measurement outcomes. In previous experiments, this “freedom of choice” was addressed by ensuring that selection of measurement settings via conventional “quantum random number generators” was spacelike separated from the entangled particle creation. This, however, left open the possibility that an unknown cause affected both the setting choices and measurement outcomes as recently as mere microseconds before each experimental trial. Here we report on a new experimental test of Bell’s inequality that, for the first time, uses distant astronomical sources as “cosmic setting generators.” In our tests with polarization-entangled photons, measurement settings were chosen using real-time observations of Milky Way stars while simultaneously ensuring locality. Assuming fair sampling for all detected photons, and that each stellar photon’s color was set at emission, we observe statistically significant ≳7.31σ and ≳11.93σ violations of Bell’s inequality with estimated p values of ≲1.8×10−13 and ≲4.0×10−33, respectively, thereby pushing back by ∼600 years the most recent time by which any local-realist influences could have engineered the observed Bell violation.},

	abstract = {The manner in which states of some quantum systems become effectively classical is of great significance for the foundations of quantum physics, as well as for problems of practical interest such as quantum engineering. In the past two decades it has become increasingly clear that many (perhaps all) of the symptoms of classicality can be induced in quantum systems by their environments. Thus decoherence is caused by the interaction in which the environment in effect monitors certain observables of the system, destroying coherence between the pointer states corresponding to their eigenvalues. This leads to environment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process associated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are stable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the universe in spite of the environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective ban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the flagrantly nonlocal “Schrödinger-cat states.” The classical structure of phase space emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic limit. Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of a point and of a classical trajectory. In measurements, einselection replaces quantum entanglement between the apparatus and the measured system with the classical correlation. Only the preferred pointer observable of the apparatus can store information that has predictive power. When the measured quantum system is microscopic and isolated, this restriction on the predictive utility of its correlations with the macroscopic apparatus results in the effective “collapse of the wave packet.” The existential interpretation implied by einselection regards observers as open quantum systems, distinguished only by their ability to acquire, store, and process information. Spreading of the correlations with the effectively classical pointer states throughout the environment allows one to understand “classical reality” as a property based on the relatively objective existence of the einselected states. Effectively classical pointer states can be “found out” without being re-prepared, e.g, by intercepting the information already present in the environment. The redundancy of the records of pointer states in the environment (which can be thought of as their “fitness” in the Darwinian sense) is a measure of their classicality. A new symmetry appears in this setting. Environment-assisted invariance or envariance sheds new light on the nature of ignorance of the state of the system due to quantum correlations with the environment and leads to Born’s rules and to reduced density matrices, ultimately justifying basic principles of the program of decoherence and einselection.},

It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large-scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large-scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. The development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

The White House and science agencies are also calling for a larger role for the federal government in quantum science.

Proponents argue that the United States needs a better plan for harvesting the potential fruits of quantum research—and for keeping up with global competitors.

The Handbook aims to focus on Internet Studies as an emerging field, each chapter seeking to provide a synthesis and critical assessment of the research in a particular area. Topics covered include social perspectives on the technology of the Internet, its role in everyday life and work, implications for communication, power, and influence, and the governance and regulation of the Internet. The Handbook is a landmark in this new interdisciplinary field, not only helping to strengthen research on the key questions, but also shape research, policy, and practice across many disciplines that are finding the Internet and its political, economic, cultural, and other societal implications increasingly central to their own key areas of inquiry.},

	shorttitle = {Introducing {Science} through {Images}},
	abstract = {As funding for basic scientific research becomes increasingly difficult to secure, public support becomes essential. Because of its promise for captivating nonexpert publics, the practice of merging art and imagery with science has been gaining traction in the scientific community. While images have been used with greater frequency in recent years, their value is often viewed as largely superficial. To the contrary, Maria E. Gigante posits in Introducing Science through Images, the value of imagery goes far beyond mere aesthetics—visual elements are powerful communication vehicles. The images examined in this volume, drawn from a wide range of historical periods, serve an introductory function—that is, they appear in a position of primacy relative to text and, like the introduction to a speech, have the potential to make audiences attentive and receptive to the forthcoming content. Gigante calls them “portal” images and explicates their utility in science communication, both to popularize and mystify science in the public eye. Gigante analyzes how science has been represented by various types of portal images: frontispieces, portraits of scientists, popular science magazine covers, and award-winning scientific images from Internet visualization competitions. Using theories of rhetoric and visual communication, she addresses the weak connection between scientific communities and the public and explores how visual elements can best be employed to garner public support for research.},

Are we all related through six degrees of separation? There is a growing awareness of the complex networks that pervade modern society. We see them in the rapid growth of the internet, the ease of global communication, the swift spread of news and information, and in the way epidemics and financial crises develop with startling speed and intensity. This introductory book on the new science of networks takes an interdisciplinary approach, using economics, sociology, computing, information science and applied mathematics to address fundamental questions about the links that connect us, and the ways that our decisions can have consequences for others.},

This is why different centrality measures have been found over the years. In this survey paper, we present past and present research works on measures of centrality in social network. For this plan, we discuss mathematical definitions and different developed centrality measures. We also present some applications of centrality measures in biology, research, security, traffic, transportation, drug, class room. At last, our future research work on centrality measure is given.},

Conversely, the work of others is often dismissed on the grounds that it is ?uncritical?. However, there are important questions about what the term critical means, about what we should be critical of, and about the form that criticism ought to take. These questions are addressed here in relation to both the role of the social researcher itself and that of researchers operating as public intellectuals. It is argued that the distinction between these roles is an important one, and has implications for what can legitimately be criticised, on what grounds, and in what way. In each case, there are proper limits to criticism, albeit different ones. Like anything else, criticism is not always a good thing.},

	abstract = {Within the last two decades, quantum technologies (QT) have made tremendous progress, moving from Nobel Prize award-winning experiments on quantum physics (1997: Chu, Cohen-Tanoudji, Phillips; 2001: Cornell, Ketterle, Wieman; 2005: Hall, Hänsch-, Glauber; 2012: Haroche, Wineland) into a cross-disciplinary field of applied research. Technologies are being developed now that explicitly address individual quantum states and make use of the ‘strange’ quantum properties, such as superposition and entanglement. The field comprises four domains: quantum communication, where individual or entangled photons are used to transmit data in a provably secure way; quantum simulation, where well-controlled quantum systems are used to reproduce the behaviour of other, less accessible quantum systems; quantum computation, which employs quantum effects to dramatically speed up certain calculations, such as number factoring; and quantum sensing and metrology, where the high sensitivity of coherent quantum systems to external perturbations is exploited to enhance the performance of measurements of physical quantities. In Europe, the QT community has profited from several EC funded coordination projects, which, among other things, have coordinated the creation of a 150-page QT Roadmap ( http://qurope.eu/h2020/qtflagship/roadmap2016 [http://qurope.eu/h2020/qtflagship/roadmap2016] ).

In principle the lessons learned may be applicable in other areas, including the eventual development of quantum computers.},

	abstract = {Janet Abbate recounts the key players and technologies that allowed the Internet to develop; but her main focus is always on the social and cultural factors that influenced the Internet's design and use. Since the late 1960s the Internet has grown from a single experimental network serving a dozen sites in the United States to a network of networks linking millions of computers worldwide. In Inventing the Internet, Janet Abbate recounts the key players and technologies that allowed the Internet to develop; but her main focus is always on the social and cultural factors that influenced the Internets design and use. The story she unfolds is an often twisting tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players, including government and military agencies, computer scientists in academia and industry, graduate students, telecommunications companies, standards organizations, and network users. The story starts with the early networking breakthroughs formulated in Cold War think tanks and realized in the Defense Department's creation of the ARPANET. It ends with the emergence of the Internet and its rapid and seemingly chaotic growth. Abbate looks at how academic and military influences and attitudes shaped both networks; how the usual lines between producer and user of a technology were crossed with interesting and unique results; and how later users invented their own very successful applications, such as electronic mail and the World Wide Web. She concludes that such applications continue the trend of decentralized, user-driven development that has characterized the Internet's entire history and that the key to the Internet's success has been a commitment to flexibility and diversity, both in technical design and in organizational culture.},

Transcription factor proteins play a key role in controlling gene expression by attaching to DNA, but constructing a quantitative model to predict the binding strength is difficult. Richard Li and colleagues from the University of Southern California compared the performance of classical machine learning with a quantum learning algorithm implemented on a quantum annealing processor. While traditional classical protocols worked best when large training sets were used, the annealing approach outperformed them with smaller datasets. These results indicate that, even while a general speedup compared to classical computing is yet to be established, quantum annealing processors may help improve machine learning approaches to practical problems where training data are scarce.},

It argues that this relationship can be understood either as an external or as an integrated relationship. In an external relationship, there is first social criticism that is then braced by discourse analysis, that is, the latter aims at giving empirical credence to the critique. However, such an external relationship cannot give us any insight concerning the critical potential that is specific to discourse analysis, precisely because in this case critique exists before and independent of discourse analysis. If, however, critique emanates from discourse analysis itself, we would speak of an integrated relationship and would no longer speak of discourse analysis and critique, but of discourse analysis as critique. It is argued that such an integrated relationship becomes visible once we think of discourse analysis as being itself a discursive formation and ask what unsettling effects this formation has on research objects, on subject formations and on the academic production context in which they are conducted.},

Chengxin Pan exposes both of these representations as expressions of Western fears and desires for certainty and predictability. His call for a more reflective and culturally sensitive understanding of China offers an important contribution to one of the big political debates of our time.'- Professor Roland Bleiker, University of Queensland, Australia'This is a brilliant and insightful treatment of Western representations of China, with a theoretical framework suggesting they come not only from China itself, but also the West. Although it is not the first treatment of this topic, it is innovative in considering the 'China threat' and 'China opportunity': both aspects of the rise of China are of crucial importance for our times. With provocative conclusions, it is a truly path-breaking contribution to the literature. I recommend it highly!'- Emeritus Professor Colin Mackerras, Griffith University, Australia'Pan has produced a book which not only challenges some basic assumptions about the nature of China's 'rise', but more importantly forces us to rethink the very basic starting points of how we know what we know about China.'- Professor Shaun Breslin, University of Warwick, UKHow is the rise of China perceived in the West? Why is it often labelled as 'threat' and/or 'opportunity'? What are the implications of these China imageries for global politics?Taking up these important questions, this groundbreaking book argues that the dominant Western perceptions of China's rise tell us less about China and more about Western self-imagination and its desire for certainty. Chengxin Pan expertly illustrates how this desire, masked as China 'knowledge', is bound up with the political economy of fears and fantasies, thereby both informing and complicating foreign policy practice in Sino-Western relations. Insofar as this vital relationship is shaped not only by China's rise, but also by the way we conceptualize its rise, this book makes a compelling case for critical reflection on China watching.Knowledge, Desire and Power in Global Politics is the first systematic and deconstructive analysis of contemporary Western representation of China's rise. Setting itself apart from the mainstream empiricist literature, its critical interpretative approach and unconventional and innovative perspective will not only strongly appeal to academics, students and the broader reading public, but also likely spark debate in the field of Chinese international relations.},

Cyberweapons can imperil economic, political, and military systems by a single act, or by multifaceted orders of effect, with wide-ranging potential consequences. Cyberwarfare occupies an ambiguous status in the conventions of the laws of war. This book addresses Ethical and legal issues surrounding cyberwarfare by considering whether the Laws of Armed Conflict apply to cyberspace and the ethical position of cyberwarfare against the background of our generally recognized moral traditions in armed conflict. The book explores these moral and legal issues and examines the key principles of jus in bello to determine how they might be applied to cyber conflicts. The distinction between civilian and combatant in this context and the level of causation necessary to elicit a response are studied and the specific operational realities implicated by particular regulatory regimes are analyzed.},

Courses, based on this book, could be offered in the Physics, Engineering, Math and Computer Science departments.  This textbook incorporates Mathematica-based examples into the book. In this way students are allowed a hands-on experience in which difficult abstract concepts are actualized by simulations. The students can ‘turn knobs" in parameter space and explore how the system under study responds. The incorporation of symbolic manipulation software into course-ware allows a more holistic approach to the teaching of difficult concepts. Mathematica software is used here because it is easy to use and allows a fast learning curve for students who have limited experience with scientific programming.},

Quantum computing is a beautiful fusion of quantum physics and computer science, incorporating some of the most stunning ideas from twentieth-century physics into an entirely new way of thinking about computation. In this book, Chris Bernhardt offers an introduction to quantum computing that is accessible to anyone who is comfortable with high school mathematics. He explains qubits, entanglement, quantum teleportation, quantum algorithms, and other quantum-related topics as clearly as possible for the general reader. Bernhardt, a mathematician himself, simplifies the mathematics as much as he can and provides elementary examples that illustrate both how the math works and what it means. Bernhardt introduces the basic unit of quantum computing, the qubit, and explains how the qubit can be measured; discusses entanglement-which, he says, is easier to describe mathematically than verbally-and what it means when two qubits are entangled (citing Einstein's characterization of what happens when the measurement of one entangled qubit affects the second as "spooky action at a distance"); and introduces quantum cryptography. He recaps standard topics in classical computing-bits, gates, and logic-and describes Edward Fredkin's ingenious billiard ball computer. He defines quantum gates, considers the speed of quantum algorithms, and describes the building of quantum computers. By the end of the book, readers understand that quantum computing and classical computing are not two distinct disciplines, and that quantum computing is the fundamental form of computing. The basic unit of computation is the qubit, not the bit.},

However, Bell's inequality delimiting local - havior and the experimental demonstration of its violation more than 25 years ago made it entirely clear that non-local properties of pure quantum states are more than an intellectual curiosity. Entanglement and non-locality are now understood to ?gure prominently in the microphysical world, a realm into which technology is rapidly hurtling. Information theory is also increasingly recognized by physicists and philosophers as intimately related to the foun- tions of mechanics. The clearest indicator of this relationship is that between quantum information and entanglement. To some degree, a deep relationship between information and mechanics in the quantum context was already there to be seen upon the introduction by Max Born and Wolfgang Pauli of the idea that the essence of pure quantum states lies in their provision of probabilities regarding the behavior of quantum systems, via what has come to be known as the Born rule. The signi?cance of the relationship between mechanics and information became even clearer with Leo Szilard's analysis of James Clerk Maxwell's infamous demon thought experiment. Here, in addition to examining both entanglement and quantum infor- tion and their relationship, I endeavor to critically assess the in?uence of the study of these subjects on the interpretation of quantum theory.},

	abstract = {Quantum Information Theory and the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics is a conceptual analysis of one the most prominent and exciting new areas of physics, providing the first full-length philosophical treatment of quantum information theory and the questions it raises for our understanding of the quantum world. Beginning from a careful, revisionary, analysis of the concepts of information in the everyday and classical information-theory settings, Christopher G. Timpson argues for an ontologically deflationary account of the nature of quantum information. Against what many have supposed, quantum information can be clearly defined (it is not a primitive or vague notion) but it is not part of the material contents of the world. Timpson's account sheds light on the nature of nonlocality and information flow in the presence of entanglement and, in particular, dissolves puzzles surrounding the remarkable process of quantum teleportation. In addition it permits a clear view of what the ontological and methodological lessons provided by quantum information theory are; lessons which bear on the gripping question of what role a concept like information has to play in fundamental physics. Topics discussed include the slogan 'Information is Physical', the prospects for an informational immaterialism (the view that information rather than matter might fundamentally constitute the world), and the status of the Church-Turing hypothesis in light of quantum computation. With a clear grasp of the concept of information in hand, Timpson turns his attention to the pressing question of whether advances in quantum information theory pave the way for the resolution of the traditional conceptual problems of quantum mechanics: the deep problems which loom over measurement, nonlocality and the general nature of quantum ontology. He marks out a number of common pitfalls to be avoided before analysing in detail some concrete proposals, including the radical quantum Bayesian programme of Caves, Fuchs, and Schack. One central moral which is drawn is that, for all the interest that the quantum information-inspired approaches hold, no cheap resolutions to the traditional problems of quantum mechanics are to be had.},

Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

To find someone's phone number with a probability of 50\%, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to access the database a minimum of 0.5N times. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O(√N) accesses to the database.},

Interest has since been growing in the area of quantum computation. One of the main difficulties of quantum computation is that decoherence destroys the information in a superposition of states contained in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. It is shown how to reduce the effects of decoherence for information stored in quantum memory, assuming that the decoherence process acts independently on each of the bits stored in memory. This involves the use of a quantum analog of errorcorrecting codes.},

Gaining Access fills the void by offering useful, prescriptive advice on how to successfully enter different field settings for interviewing and observation. The detailed methodological guidelines presented by the authors are reinforced in a set of case studies by expert researchers from diverse disciplinary backgrounds on a wide variety of formal and informal settings, from working with ethnic minorities in Bosnia to studying prisons, sex workers, welfare offices, and the clergy. This book will provide useful ideas to experienced qualitative researchers as well as invaluable advice to novices conducting their first study.},

	abstract = {Ethnography is a qualitative research method used to study people and cultures. It is largely adopted in disciplines outside software engineering, including different areas of computer science. Ethnography can provide an in-depth understanding of the socio-technological realities surrounding everyday software development practice, i.e., it can help to uncover not only what practitioners do, but also why they do it. Despite its potential, ethnography has not been widely adopted by empirical software engineering researchers, and receives little attention in the related literature. The main goal of this paper is to explain how empirical software engineering researchers would benefit from adopting ethnography. This is achieved by explicating four roles that ethnography can play in furthering the goals of empirical software engineering: to strengthen investigations into the social and human aspects of software engineering; to inform the design of software engineering tools; to improve method and process development; and to inform research programmes. This article introduces ethnography, explains its origin, context, strengths and weaknesses, and presents a set of dimensions that position ethnography as a useful and usable approach to empirical software engineering research. Throughout the paper, relevant examples of ethnographic studies of software practice are used to illustrate the points being made.},

	abstract = {In this major new work by one of the leading writers on Utopian Studies, Ruth Levitas argues that a prospective future of ecological and economic crises poses a challenge to the utopian imaginary, to conceive a better world and alternative future. Utopia as Method does not construe utopia as goal or blueprint, but as a holistic, reflexive method for developing what those possible futures might be. It begins by treating utopia as the quest for grace, through a hermeneutics that recovers the utopian meaning in our culture, explored through colour and music. Moving from the existential to the social, it draws on H. G. Wells's claim that the creation of utopias is the distinctive and proper method of sociology, and on the tentative reappearance of utopia in contemporary social theory. It proposes a constructive method, the Imaginary Reconstitution of Society. This fusion of explicitly normative social theory and analytic critique rehabilitates utopia as an integral part of sociology, and offers a means of collective engagement in shaping a better tomorrow.},

At once a Gothic thriller, a passionate romance, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of science, Frankenstein tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein. Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts but; upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature's hideousness. Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein. Frankenstein, an instant bestseller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story, but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? How far can we go in tampering with Nature? In our age, filled with news of organ donation, genetic engineering, and bio-terrorism, these questions are more relevant than ever.},

Among the contributors, Charles Ess uses the work of Jürgen Habermas and the Frankfurt School to examine hypertext's potential for true democratization. Stuart Moulthrop turns to Deleuze and Guattari as a point of departure for a study of the relation of hypertext and political power. Espen Aarseth places hypertext within a framework created by other forms of electronic textuality. David Kolb explores what hypertext implies for philosophy and philosophical discourse. Jane Yellowlees Douglas, Gunnar Liestol, and Mireille Rosello use contemporary theory to come to terms with hypertext narrative. Terrence Harpold investigates the hypertextual fiction of Michael Joyce.

As we approach the twenty-first century, America is turning into an electronic republic, a democratic system that is vastly increasing the people's day-to-day influence on decisions of state." Grossman's forecast implied a sea change in the way citizens would interact with, and participate in, their representative government; a revamping of the way Americans would 'do' citizenship. Harnessing the power of technology to promote the ideal of democracy that first pulsed through our nation over 230 years ago may be a feasible achievement in a technocratic age, but whether technology can help achieve a revolution as seismic as the political one that our founding fathers initiated may be a practical impossibility. Fusing the power of technology and democratic ideals opens opportunities for greater access to information and offers a medium for people to be heard and express their voice with dissemination to the masses through digital tools, such as blogs, podcasts, and wikis. Indeed, the emergence of the Internet as a nearly ubiquitous element of American society has brought about new opportunities to enhance citizen engagement in democratic politics and to increase the level of civic engagement among American citizens. Despite such rhetoric, however, research has indicated that Grossman's "electronic republic" has, for the most part, failed to come to fruition."--Book cover.},

Life on the Screen traces a set of boundary negotiations, telling the story of the changing impact of the computer on our psychological lives and our evolving ideas about minds, bodies, and machines. What is emerging, Turkle says, is a new sense of identity- as decentered and multiple. She describes trends in computer design, in artificial intelligence, and in people's experiences of virtual environments that confirm a dramatic shift in our notions of self, other, machine, and world. The computer emerges as an object that brings postmodernism down to earth.},

The purpose of this phenomenological study was to examine the role of the Internet in facilitating the sexual orientation identity development process of gay and bisexual male adolescents. Qualitative interviews were conducted with an ethnically diverse sample of 63 gay/bisexual male adolescents (ages 15–23). Participants reported using a range of Internet applications as they explored and came to accept their sexual orientation identity, with the intended purpose and degree of anonymity desired determining which applications were used. Youth reported that the Internet provided a range of functions with regard to the exploration and acceptance of their sexual orientation identity, including: 1) increasing self awareness of sexual orientation identity; 2) learning about gay/bisexual community life; 3) communicating with other gay/bisexual people; 4) meeting other gay/bisexual people; 5) finding comfort and acceptance with sexual orientation; and 6) facilitating the coming out process. Future research and practice may explore the Internet as a platform for promoting the healthy development of gay and bisexual male adolescents by providing a developmentally and culturally appropriate venue for the exploration and subsequent commitment to an integrated sexual orientation identity.},

Previous research in this area has not accounted for both online and off-line communication, has only been examined with cross-sectional data, and has primarily been studied in Israel. To address these gaps with a U.S. data set, 2,669 conversations were analyzed over 6-day periods using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Indeed, unlike participants from racially or educationally advantaged groups, participants who were from a racially marginalized group or lacked college training were more likely to broaden social networks online rather than face-to-face with interracial and weak tie exchanges. This proof of concept of social diversification theory across cultures is the first to use real-time, within-person measures of both race and tie strength.},

The first is that one cannot understand the role of social media in collective action without first taking into account the political environment in which they operate. The second principle states that a significant increase in the use of the new media is much more likely to follow a significant amount of protest activity than to precede it. The study examines these two principles using political, media, and protest data from twenty Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority.The findings provide strong support for the validity of the claims.},

	abstract = {The collective aims of the three biggest providers of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are to promote anywhere, anytime learning; to increase access to world-class higher education; and to connect and empower learners. Through analysis of focus group discussions between MOOC participants at the Australian National University, this study shows that MOOCs do appear to empower some users, but perhaps not in the ways – or for the people – that providers had expected. Rather than simply producing a new means for disadvantaged groups to access higher education – which can, in turn, empower them to have more opportunities in social, political and economic avenues of life – even people who are already enrolled at university can be empowered, psychologically, by MOOCs to feel confident in their abilities and to try learning new things without fear of failure. The types of people most likely to be psychologically empowered by MOOCs are those who are intrinsically motivated to learn for learning’s sake and who are anxious about the prospect of failure with regards to academic credit and course fees. Conversely, those who are more driven by extrinsic rewards may be more suited to a formally-graded learning environment, where fear of failure and financial investment in learning are regarded as motivating rather than de-motivating forces. These findings suggest that, while they may not have the same impact on all participants, MOOCs can still be a beneficial education resource with an ability to empower even already well-educated members of society.},

Cyberbullying victimization is one such offense that has recently received a fair amount of attention. The present report synthesizes ﬁndings from quantitative research on cyberbullying victimization. An integrative deﬁnition for the term cyberbullying is provided, differences between traditional bullying and cyberbullying are explained, areas of convergence and divergence are offered, and sampling and/or methodological explanations for the inconsistencies in the literature are considered. About 20–40\% of all youths have experienced cyberbullying at least once in their lives. Demographic variables such as age and gender do not appear to predict cyberbullying victimization. Evidence suggests that victimization is associated with serious psychosocial, affective, and academic problems. The report concludes by outlining several areas of concern in cyberbullying research and discusses ways that future research can remedy them.},

Utilizing self-report measures, three types of social media were examined: Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Analyses indicated that greater levels of self-objectifying social media use predicted greater body shame among youth, and this was mediated by an associated increase in body surveillance. This mediation was moderated by self-monitoring and gender, such that the mediating role of body surveillance was stronger among girls and adolescents who are particularly focused on others for approval (i.e., high in self-monitoring).

	abstract = {Theodor Adorno is a widely-studied figure, but most often with regard to his work on cultural theory, philosophy and aesthetics. The Sociology of Theodor Adorno provides the first thorough English-language account of Adorno's sociological thinking. Matthias Benzer reads Adorno's sociology through six major themes: the problem of conceptualising capitalist society; empirical research; theoretical analysis; social critique; the sociological text; and the question of the non-social. Benzer explains the methodological and theoretical ideas informing Adorno's reflections on sociology and illustrates Adorno's approach to examining social life, including astrology, sexual taboos and racial prejudice. Benzer clarifies Adorno's sociology in relation to his work in other disciplines and the inspiration his sociology took from social thinkers such as Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Kracauer and Benjamin. The book raises critical questions about the viability of Adorno's sociological mode of procedure and its potential contributions and challenges to current debates in social science.},

	abstract = {The governance of the Internet provides one of the most important arenas in which new ideas regarding Internet studies can be applied and tested. This paper critiques the prevailing conceptualization of Internet governance. The label is routinely applied to the study of a few formal global institutions with limited or no impact on governance, but not to studies of the many activities that actually shape and regulate the use and evolution of the Internet, such as Internet service provider interconnection, security incident response or content filtering. Consequently, current conceptualizations of Internet governance inflate the presence and influence of state actors. Furthermore, they undermine efforts to understand how large-scale distributed systems in the global economy can be governed in the absence of formalized international regimes. We conclude by discussing how concepts of networked governance can be applied and extended to illuminate the study of Internet governance.},

	abstract = {Extending the coherence time of molecules
Quantum properties of atoms and molecules can be exploited for precision measurements or quantum information processing. The complex state structure of molecules can be exploited, but it is hard to preserve the coherence between pairs of those states in applications. Park et al. created fermionic molecules of NaK in the rovibrational ground state that maintained coherence between their nuclear spin states on a time scale of 1 second. This long coherence time makes dipolar ultracold molecules a valuable quantum resource.
Science, this issue p. 372
Coherence, the stability of the relative phase between quantum states, is central to quantum mechanics and its applications. For ultracold dipolar molecules at sub-microkelvin temperatures, internal states with robust coherence are predicted to offer rich prospects for quantum many-body physics and quantum information processing. We report the observation of stable coherence between nuclear spin states of ultracold fermionic sodium-potassium (NaK) molecules in the singlet rovibrational ground state. Ramsey spectroscopy reveals coherence times on the scale of 1 second; this enables high-resolution spectroscopy of the molecular gas. Collisional shifts are shown to be absent down to the 100-millihertz level. This work opens the door to the use of molecules as a versatile quantum memory and for precision measurements on dipolar quantum matter.
The use of nuclear spin states extends the coherence time of dipolar ultracold molecules, making them a valuable quantum resource.

But how much do we know about the Internet - its history, its technology, its culture, and its uses? What are its implications for the business world and society at large? The diffusion has been so rapid that it has outpaced the capacity for well-grounded analysis. Soem say everything will change, others that little will change. Manuel Castells is widely regarded as the leading analyst of the Information Age and the Network Society. In addition to his academic work, he acts as adviser at the highest international levels. In this short, accessible, and informative book, he brings his experience and knowledge to bear on the Internet Galaxy. How did it all begin? What are the cultures that make up and contest the Internet? How is it shaping the new business organization and re-shaping older business organizations? What are the realities of the digital divide? How has the Internet affected social and cultural organization, political participation and communication, and urban living? These are just some of the questions addressed in this much needed book. Castells avoids any predictions or prescriptions - there have been enough of those - but instead draws on an extraordinary range of detailed evidence and research to describe what is happening, and to help us understand how the Internet has become the medium of the new network society.},

Daily life is connected life, its rhythms driven by endless email pings and responses, the chimes and beeps of continually arriving text messages, tweets and retweets, Facebook updates, pictures and videos to post and discuss. Our perpetual connectedness gives us endless opportunities to be part of the give-and-take of networking. Some worry that this new environment makes us isolated and lonely. But in Networked, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman show how the large, loosely knit social circles of networked individuals expand opportunities for learning, problem solving, decision making, and personal interaction. The new social operating system of "networked individualism" liberates us from the restrictions of tightly knit groups; it also requires us to develop networking skills and strategies, work on maintaining ties, and balance multiple overlapping networks. Rainie and Wellman outline the "triple revolution" that has brought on this transformation: the rise of social networking, the capacity of the Internet to empower individuals, and the always-on connectivity of mobile devices. Drawing on extensive evidence, they examine how the move to networked individualism has expanded personal relationships beyond households and neighborhoods; transformed work into less hierarchical, more team-driven enterprises; encouraged individuals to create and share content; and changed the way people obtain information. Rainie and Wellman guide us through the challenges and opportunities of living in the evolving world of networked individuals.},

	abstract = {Information is stored, transmitted and processed by physical means. Thus, the concept of information and computation can be formulated in the con text of a physical theory and the study of information requires ultimately experimentation. This sentence, innocuous at first glance, leads to non-trivial consequences. Following Moore's law, about every 18 months microprocessors double their speed and, it seems, the only way to make them significantly faster is to make them smaller. In the not too distant future they will reach the point where the logic gates are so small that they consist of only a few atoms each. Then quantum-mechanical effects will become important. Thus, if computers are to continue to become faster (and therefore smaller), new, quantum technology must replace or supplement what we have now. But it turns out that such technology can offer much more than smaller and faster microprocessors. Several recent theoretical results have shown that quantum effects may be harnessed to provide qualitatively new modes of communication and computation, in some cases much more powerful than their classical counterparts. This new quantum technology is being born in many laboratories. The last two decades have witnessed experiments in which single quantum particles of different kinds were controlled and manipulated with an unprecedented preci sion. Many "gedanken" experiments, so famous in the early days of quantum mechanics, have been carried out.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing technologies have become a hot topic in academia and industry receiving much attention and financial support from all sides. Building a quantum computer that can be used practically is in itself an outstanding challenge that has become the ‘new race to the moon’. Next to researchers and vendors of future computing technologies, national authorities are showing strong interest in maturing this technology due to its known potential to break many of today’s encryption techniques, which would have significant and potentially disruptive impact on our society. It is, however, quite likely that quantum computing has beneficial impact on many computational disciplines. In this article we describe our vision of future developments in scientific computing that would be enabled by the advent of software-programmable quantum computers. We thereby assume that quantum computers will form part of a hybrid accelerated computing platform like GPUs and co-processor cards do today. In particular, we address the potential of quantum algorithms to bring major breakthroughs in applied mathematics and its applications. Finally, we give several examples that demonstrate the possible impact of quantum-accelerated scientific computing on society.},

	abstract = {A crucial challenge for economists is figuring out how people interpret the world and form expectations that will likely influence their economic activity. Inflation, asset prices, exchange rates, investment, and consumption are just some of the economic variables that are largely explained by expectations. Here George Evans and Seppo Honkapohja bring new explanatory power to a variety of expectation formation models by focusing on the learning factor. Whereas the rational expectations paradigm offers the prevailing method to determining expectations, it assumes very theoretical knowledge on the part of economic actors. Evans and Honkapohja contribute to a growing body of research positing that households and firms learn by making forecasts using observed data, updating their forecast rules over time in response to errors. This book is the first systematic development of the new statistical learning approach. Depending on the particular economic structure, the economy may converge to a standard rational-expectations or a "rational bubble" solution, or exhibit persistent learning dynamics. The learning approach also provides tools to assess the importance of new models with expectational indeterminacy, in which expectations are an independent cause of macroeconomic fluctuations. Moreover, learning dynamics provide a theory for the evolution of expectations and selection between alternative equilibria, with implications for business cycles, asset price volatility, and policy. This book provides an authoritative treatment of this emerging field, developing the analytical techniques in detail and using them to synthesize and extend existing research.},

	abstract = {From Paul Mason, the award-winning Channel 4 presenter, Postcapitalism is a guide to our era of seismic economic change, and how we can build a more equal society. Over the past two centuries or so, capitalism has undergone continual change - economic cycles that lurch from boom to bust - and has always emerged transformed and strengthened. Surveying this turbulent history, Paul Mason wonders whether today we are on the brink of a change so big, so profound, that this time capitalism itself, the immensely complex system by which entire societies function, has reached its limits and is changing into something wholly new.At the heart of this change is information technology: a revolution that, as Mason shows, has the potential to reshape utterly our familiar notions of work, production and value; and to destroy an economy based on markets and private ownership - in fact, he contends, it is already doing so. Almost unnoticed, in the niches and hollows of the market system, whole swathes of economic life are changing.. Goods and services that no longer respond to the dictates of neoliberalism are appearing, from parallel currencies and time banks, to cooperatives and self-managed online spaces. Vast numbers of people are changing their behaviour, discovering new forms of ownership, lending and doing business that are distinct from, and contrary to, the current system of state-backed corporate capitalism.In this groundbreaking book Mason shows how, from the ashes of the recent financial crisis, we have the chance to create a more socially just and sustainable global economy. Moving beyond capitalism, he shows, is no longer a utopian dream. This is the first time in human history in which, equipped with an understanding of what is happening around us, we can predict and shape, rather than simply react to, seismic change.},

Explicitly identifying one’s theoretical orientation can provide an orderly schematic for linking observations from separate investigations (i.e. qualitative, quantitative) thereby facilitating understandings and guiding research designs particularly in fields of social and health sciences where complex phenomena are an aspect of the subject of inquiry. Although this has been established, how researchers might position their research theoretically to guide mixed methods research is less clear. In this paper, we propose the Before Design Theoretical Placement as a general guide for specifying and locating studies in a broader theoretical grounding, and discuss how it may inform overall study considerations. We then use this approach to illustrate how theories and methods can work together to facilitate professional knowledge development from a relational perspective.},

This advanced text introduces the principles of noncooperative game theory-including strategic form games, Nash equilibria, subgame perfection, repeated games, and games of incomplete information-in a direct and uncomplicated style that will acquaint students with the broad spectrum of the field while highlighting and explaining what they need to know at any given point. The analytic material is accompanied by many applications, examples, and exercises. The theory of noncooperative games studies the behavior of agents in any situation where each agent's optimal choice may depend on a forecast of the opponents' choices. "Noncooperative" refers to choices that are based on the participant's perceived selfinterest. Although game theory has been applied to many fields, Fudenberg and Tirole focus on the kinds of game theory that have been most useful in the study of economic problems. They also include some applications to political science. The fourteen chapters are grouped in parts that cover static games of complete information, dynamic games of complete information, static games of incomplete information, dynamic games of incomplete information, and advanced topics.},

I focus on the case of Mars One—an initiative that aims to establish a human settlement on Mars in the 2020s—and discuss interviews undertaken with some of the individuals who have volunteered to be the first humans to live on Mars, drawing on STS work on futures and sociotechnical imaginaries and scholarly discussions of utopia. Seeing themselves as part of a project that would start to “establish what it means to live on another planet,” I discuss how interviewees talked about how sociotechnical relations could be remade in the future, both on Earth and on Mars, through the pursuit of this technoscientific project.

In this article, I will suggest that from the perspective of hermeneutic TA it becomes clear that TA has directed much attention to the “vanguard visions” of some rather elitist visionaries, whose narratives of technological futures have attracted a lot of media attention and stirred up societal debates. Nanotechnology is the most pertinent example. Meaning has been attributed to such comprehensive, techno-scientific futures, elevating them to form the backdrop of public discourses, technology assessments and policy-making. Such attribution carries a prescriptive power and pushes to political action or further social scientific inquiry. Acknowledging this should raise the awareness that many people’s visions of the future are not part of the policy debates in which TA is involved and in which the future is negotiated. This imbalance might be expressed by saying that they do “not have a future”. In the present article, I will explore this notion and its normative implications.},

This will be used to analyse a case study of a community mental health service user, for whom the future exists as hopeful potential for a better life. The concepts of actual occasion and nexus are recruited to highlight the organized formation of the service user’s home, which enables the anticipatory perception of future life. The paper concludes by arguing for an approach to the study of mental distress that takes seriously the active role of the future on the present, and how such a process is organized as a relational phenomenon in domestic home environments.},

Drawing upon art, science, philosophy, and the history of culture, Lewis Mumford explained the origin of the machine age and traced its social results, asserting that the development of modern technology had its roots in the Middle Ages rather than the Industrial Revolution. Mumford sagely argued that it was the moral, economic, and political choices we made, not the machines that we used, that determined our then industrially driven economy. Equal parts powerful history and polemic criticism, Technics and Civilization was the first comprehensive attempt in English to portray the development of the machine age over the last thousand years—and to predict the pull the technological still holds over us today.  “The questions posed in the first paragraph of Technics and Civilization still deserve our attention, nearly three quarters of a century after they were written.”—Journal of Technology and Culture},

Featuring a new introduction by Casey Nelson Blake, this classic text provides the essence of Mumford's views on the distinct yet interpenetrating roles of technology and the arts in modern culture. Mumford contends that modern man's overemphasis on technics has contributed to the depersonalization and emptiness of much of twentieth-century life. He issues a call for a renewed respect for artistic impulses and achievements. His repeated insistence that technological development take the Human as its measure - as well as his impassioned plea for humanity to make the most of its "splendid potentialities and promise" and reverse its progress toward anomie and destruction - is ever more relevant as the new century dawns.},

Despite the crucial role that technical innovation and adaptation play in the process of international development, many macroanalyses of social change focus little explicit attention on technology. Only neoevolutionary theory discusses its role in long-term social change, and then in ways that miss some key dimensions. The author argues that technology is a social product designed to fit the needs of the rich and powerful. In the contemporary world, it is usually produced by a highly organized (and expansive) research and development (R\&D) industry, often explicitly linked to military-industrial complexes. Rhetoric about increased globalization notwithstanding, technology is a key resource in the present capitalist world-economy that is very unevenly distributed, with the advanced industrial "core" states (and their giant transnational corporations) controlling technological innovation and dissemination. Even newly industrializing countries (NICs) like South Korea, which many consider technologically sophisticated, experience profound technological dependence, limiting their prospects for truly autonomous economic growth. Differential control of technology and technological innovation is a defining trait of global inequality in the late twentieth century.]},

I show that English and Yoruba (a West African language) predicate in different ways, and consequently postulate different kinds of objects. This, in turn, produces different constructions of number: how we count depends on how we conceive objects to exist. Yoruba numbers are verbal constructs, not adjectival, as in English; they hold the object to exist in a collective mode, with a particular numerosity. The numeral system begins with aggregates, and then, by a process of subtraction, breaks these down through the concurrent use of bases twenty, ten and five. The number system can thus be shown to be intimately related to the conceptual frame that the linguistic structure lays down.]},

At the same time, there has been much concern about how to deal, methodologically, with the issue of reflexivity in sociological (and historical) studies of science. This paper considers implications of the reflexivity issue for sociological and historical accounts of technology. Drawing on characterizations of technology (mainly by its historians), the paper develops several senses in which technology is conceived to differ significantly from science. Accordingly, assumptions and approaches, contexts and expectations associated with the sociology of scientific knowledge may be inappropriate to the study of technology. These differences can be used to gain insights into the reflexivity question. If, as we have done in science, we look to the activity we study for guidance about how to study it, we may find technology to warrant a different conception of the location and purposes of its analysts than does science - a conception of the studier not as an isolated knower, but as a socially and politically involved co-creator. In line with recent suggestions of Sal Restivo and Bruno Latour, our activity as STS scholars might then better be characterized as a technology of technology (or science), rather than as a science of science (or technology).]},

There is a risk that engagements become limited to “laboratory experiments,” highly controlled and foreclosed by participation experts, particularly in upstream techno-sciences. In this paper, we propose a way to open up the “participation laboratory” by engaging localized, self-assembling publics in ways that respect and mobilize their ecologies of participation. Our innovative reflexive methodology introduced participatory methods to public engagement with upstream techno-science, with the public contributing to both the content and format of the project. Reflecting on the project, we draw attention to the largely overlooked issue of temporalities of participation, and the co-production of futures and publics in participation methodologies. We argue that many public participation methodologies are underpinned by the open futures model, which imagines the future as a space of unrestrained creativity. We contrast that model with the lived futures model typical of localized publics, which respects latency of materials and processes but imposes limits on creativity. We argue that to continue being societally relevant and scientifically important, public participation methods should reconcile the open future of research with the lived futures of localized publics.},

We draw on a body of literature that argues how together, users and technologies participate in carrying out practices that actively shape outcomes, and we show how and why this applies to sustainability. The article presents the case of the Toyota Prius, analyzing Toyota’s intent in designing a sustainable car and contrasting it with the perspectives of thirty-eight of its drivers.

I argue that there have been two paradigms in the evolution of futures studies so far, and there are signs of emergence of a new one. Both of the existing paradigms have had many rival macro-level methodological approaches, ontological and epistemological branches, and phases of evolution. The ﬁrst paradigm is the age-old prediction tradition that combines thinking about the future into mystic explanations. This line of thinking bases its argument on the deterministic future and effects of the world of spirits. The second paradigm was basically started in the U.S. military after World War II. This modern line of thinking bases its argument on indeterministic futures, probabilities, aim to control and plan, modelling and systems thinking, and the effects of external trends. The new emerging paradigm may base its line of thinking on disconnecting from the western control based technical thinking, and accepting internal dynamic ﬂuctuations, paradoxes and dialectic thinking.},

	isbn = {978-0-262-06203-9},
	abstract = {For many years it was fashionable to treat macroeconomics and microeconomics as separate subjects without looking too deeply at the relationship between the two. But in the 1970s there occurred an episode of high inflation and high unemployment, which was inconsistent with orthodox theory. As a result, macroeconomists began to pay much greater attention to the microfoundations of their subject. In this book Roger E. A. Farmer takes a somewhat controversial point of view, arguing for the future of macroeconomics as a branch of applied general equilibrium theory. His main theme is that macroeconomics is best viewed as the study of equilibrium environments in which the welfare theorems break down. This approach makes it possible to discuss the role of government policies in a context in which policy may serve some purpose. Since the publication of the first edition in 1993, self-fulfilling prophecies has become a major competitor to the real business-cycle view of economic fluctuations. The second edition has been updated in three ways: (1) problems are included at the end of every chapter, and a study guide containing sample answers to all of the problems is available; (2) a new chapter discusses research from the past five years on business fluctuations in multisector models; and (3) the chapter on representative agent growth models now includes an appendix that explains the transversality condition.},

We have heard how these bulbs changed hands hundreds of times in a single day, and how some bulbs, sold and resold for thousands of guilders, never even existed. Tulipmania is seen as an example of the gullibility of crowds and the dangers of financial speculation.But it wasn't like that. As Anne Goldgar reveals in "Tulipmania", not one of these stories is true. Making use of extensive archival research, she lays waste to the legends, revealing that while the 1630s did see a speculative bubble in tulip prices, neither the height of the bubble nor its bursting were anywhere near as dramatic as we tend to think. By clearing away the accumulated myths, Goldgar is able to show us instead the far more interesting reality: the ways in which tulipmania reflected deep anxieties about the transformation of Dutch society in the Golden Age.},

However, it is well known that changes in expectations cannot generate positive co-movement between consumption, investment and employment in the most standard neo-classical business cycle models. This gives rise to the question of whether changes in expectation can cause business cycle fluctuations in neo-classical setting or whether such a phenomenon is inherently related to market imperfections. This paper offers a systematic exploration of this issue. Our finding is that expectation driven business cycle fluctuation can arise in neo-classical models when one allows for a sufficient rich description of the inter-sectorial production technology, however such a structure is rarely allowed in macro-models. In particular, the key characteristic which we isolate as giving rise to the possibility of Expectation Driven Business Cycles is that intermediate good producers exhibit cost complementarities (i.e., economies of scope) when supplying intermediate goods to different sectors of the economy.},

	isbn = {978-0-415-56174-7},
	abstract = {Inflation is regarded by the many as a menace that damages business and can only make life worse for households. Keeping it low depends critically on ensuring that firms and workers expect it to be low. So expectations of inflation are a key influence on national economic welfare. This collection pulls together a galaxy of world experts (including Roy Batchelor, Richard Curtin and Staffan Linden) on inflation expectations to debate different aspects of the issues involved. The main focus of the volume is on likely inflation developments.  A number of factors have led practitioners and academic observers of monetary policy to place increasing emphasis recently on inflation expectations. One is the spread of inflation targeting, invented in New Zealand over 15 years ago, but now encompassing many important economies including Brazil, Canada, Israel and Great Britain. Even more significantly, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the United States Federal Bank are the leading members of another group of monetary institutions all considering or implementing moves in the same direction. A second is the large reduction in actual inflation that has been observed in most countries over the past decade or so.  These considerations underscore the critical – and largely underrecognized - importance of inflation expectations. They emphasize the importance of the issues, and the great need for a volume that offers a clear, systematic treatment of them. This book, under the steely editorship of Peter Sinclair, should prove very important for policy makers and monetary economists alike.},

	abstract = {This collection of essays uses the lens of rational expectations theory to examine how governments anticipate and plan for inflation, and provides insight into the pioneering research for which Thomas Sargent was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in economics. Rational expectations theory is based on the simple premise that people will use all the information available to them in making economic decisions, yet applying the theory to macroeconomics and econometrics is technically demanding. Here, Sargent engages with practical problems in economics in a less formal, noneconometric way, demonstrating how rational expectations can satisfactorily interpret a range of historical and contemporary events. He focuses on periods of actual or threatened depreciation in the value of a nation's currency. Drawing on historical attempts to counter inflation, from the French Revolution and the aftermath of World War I to the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, Sargent finds that there is no purely monetary cure for inflation; rather, monetary and fiscal policies must be coordinated. This fully expanded edition of Rational Expectations and Inflation includes Sargent's 2011 Nobel lecture, "United States Then, Europe Now." It also features new articles on the macroeconomics of the French Revolution and government budget deficits.},

The assessment, as good in content as well as in participants, took place in Amalfi, Italy, with the participation of Merton himself and under the auspices of the Italian Sociology Association. Carlo Mongardini aptly summarizes the unique impact of Merton on the social theory of our century. "His strength as a classic writer lies in his balance, unveiling complexity, and in his humanism which looks beyond the apparent simplicity and coherence of social reality."A special treat is the final chapter by Merton reviewing "Unanticipated Conse-quences and Kindred Sociological Ideas." In it, he ranges from the historical an-tecedents of the concept to his own evolution in the use and expansion of the idea. Merton approaches the development of his thought as installments rather than sim-ple evolution, and in so doing gives us unique insight into how he built upon his originating notions in the context of social science as it existed in the United States. Tensions between integrating scholarship and reaching the general public provide a special insight into Merton that might prove new even to those who know his work well.Contributors to this original volume include: Volker Meja, Nico Stehr, Paolo Ammassari, Gianni Statera, Birgitta Nedelmann, Harriet Zuckerman, Piotr Sztompka, Peter Gerlich, Charles Crothers, Elena Besozzi, and Arnold Zongerle, among others. The chapters address the full range of Merlon's work, with special emphasis on such areas as anomie, structural analysis, the relationship of theory to research, patterns of latent and manifest influence, and even the application of Mertonian concepts to the analysis of Merton as a scholar. This unusual compendium, translated from the Italian, will interest social researchers across the academic spectrum.},

Rather than speculating upon what the future might bring, the volume interrogates the metaphors and practices through which the future is mobilized as an object of present day action and agency. The book shifts the analytical gaze from looking into the future to looking at the future as a sociological phenomenon in its own right. Futures are thus contested in as much as they register differences of interest, time frame or organizational and political form. Contestation is also evident in the ascendancy of certain discourses, languages and metaphors which foreclose some futures whilst facilitating others. But futures are far from being simply linguistic abstractions, and in fact can often be seen to harden into material entrenchment as expectations become scripted into 'path dependency' and 'lock in'. Contested Futures is an invaluable analysis for both academics and policy actors seeking a better understanding of the ubiquity of futures-discourse in the context of today’s uncertainties.},

It is this key futuristic element in these arguments that is the focus of this article. We examine how competing visions of utopia or dystopia are defended through the use of diverse vocabularies, metaphors, associations and appeals to authority. Our case study explores how these rhetorical processes play out in the debate about embryo stem cell research in UK national press and TV news media. The findings show how predictions from those in favour of embryo stem cell research are supported by both hype and by anti-hype, by inconsistent appeals to the technologies' innovative status and by the selective deconstruction of concepts such as 'potential' and 'hope'. The debate also mobilises binary oppositions around reason versus emotion, science versus religion and fact versus fiction. This article highlights how traditional assertions of expertise are now combined with ideas about compassion and respect for democracy and diversity. It also highlights the fact that although news reporters are often responding to topical events the real focus is often on years, even decades ahead. Close attention to how images of the future are constructed, and the evolution of new strategies for legitimation are, we suggest, important areas of on-going research, particularly in discussions of scientific and medical developments and policy.},

This paper considers how, when making projections that set up expectations about their futures, firms also acknowledge and detail the risk factors that they face in their operations. In other words, in addition to projecting optimistic scenarios, firms advance much more pessimistic images of futures that they wish to avoid: possible failures, disappointments and financial losses. I examine such pessimistic projections in company filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and investigate their discursive character. I ask what value such pessimism might hold for STS scholars interested in the mangle of science and capital. I sample the SEC filings of three companies: deCODE Genetics, DNAPrint Genomics Inc. and NitroMed Inc. In their own particular ways, these projections exemplify the volatility and the promise of the life sciences in the 21st century. My reading shows that such pessimistic risk factor statements provide interesting commentary on the dynamics of risk and innovation in the context of contemporary biocapital, raising questions to which analysts to date have given little attention.},

	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mind-identity/},
	abstract = {The identity theory of mind holds that states and processes of the mindare identical to states and processes of the brain. Strictly speaking,it need not hold that the mind is identical to the brain. Idiomaticallywe do use ‘She has a good mind’ and ‘She has a goodbrain’ interchangeably but we would hardly say ‘Her mindweighs fifty ounces’. Here I take identifying mind and brain asbeing a matter of identifying processes and perhaps states of the mindand brain. Consider an experience of pain, or of seeing something, orof having a mental image. The identity theory of mind is to the effectthat these experiences just are brain processes, not merelycorrelated with brain processes. , Some philosophers hold that though experiences are brain processesthey nevertheless have fundamentally non-physical, psychical,properties, sometimes called ‘qualia’. Here I shall takethe identity theory as denying the existence of such irreduciblenon-physical properties. Some identity theorists give a behaviouristicanalysis of mental states, such as beliefs and desires, butothers, sometimes called ‘central state materialists’, saythat mental states are actual brain states. Identity theorists oftendescribe themselves as ‘materialists’ but‘physicalists’ may be a better word. That is, one might bea materialist about mind but nevertheless hold that there are entitiesreferred to in physics that are not happily described as‘material’., In taking the identity theory (in its various forms) as a species ofphysicalism, I should say that this is an ontological, not atranslational physicalism. It would be absurd to try to translatesentences containing the word ‘brain’ or the word‘sensation’ into sentences about electrons, protons and soon. Nor can we so translate sentences containing the word‘tree’. After all ‘tree’ is largely learnedostensively, and is not even part of botanical classification. If wewere small enough a dandelion might count as a tree. Nevertheless aphysicalist could say that trees are complicated physical mechanisms.The physicalist will deny strong emergence in the sense of somephilosophers, such as Samuel Alexander and possibly C.D. Broad . Thelatter remarked (Broad 1937) that as far as was known at that time theproperties of common salt cannot be deduced from the properties ofsodium in isolation and of chlorine in isolation. (He put it tooepistemologically: chaos theory shows that even in a deterministictheory physical consequences can outrun predictability.) Of course thephysicalist will not deny the harmless sense of "emergence" in which anapparatus is not just a jumble of its parts (Smart 1981).},

	isbn = {978-0-19-533321-3},
	abstract = {Studies of mind, thought and reason have tended to marginalize the role of bodily form, real-world action, and environmental backdrop. In recent years, both in philosophy and cognitive science, this tendency has been identified and, increasingly, resisted. The result is a plethora of work on what has become known as embodied, situated, distributed, and even 'extended' cognition. Work in this new, loosely knit field depicts thought and reason as in some way inextricably tied to the details of our gross bodily form, our habits of action and intervention, and the enabling web of social, cultural, and technological scaffolding in which we live, move, learn, and think. But exactly what kind of link is at issue? And what difference might such a link or links make to our best philosophical, psychological, and computational models of thought and reason? These are among the large unsolved problems in this increasingly popular field.  Drawing upon recent work in psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, human-computer systems, and beyond, Supersizing the Mind offers both a tour of the emerging landscape, and a sustained argument in favor of one approach to the key issues. That approach combines the use of representational, computational, and information-theoretic tools with an appreciation of the importance of context, timing, biomechanics, and dynamics. More controversially, it depicts some coalitions of biological and non-biological resources as the extended cognitive circuitry of individual minds.  With a substantial foreword by David Chalmers, Supersizing the Mind is essential reading for all those interested in embodied cognition, the extended mind, and the likely shape of twenty-first century cognitive scientific explanation.},

In slogan form, “there cannot be anA-difference without a B-difference”., As we shall see, this slogan can be cashed out in many different ways.But to illustrate the basic idea, imagine that there is a perfectforger. Her copies of paintings not only fool the art dealers, but arein fact exact duplicates of the originals down to the preciseplacement of every molecule of pigment—indeed, down to everymicrophysical detail. Suppose that she produces such a copy of ElGreco’s A View of Toledo. It is of course differentfrom the original in various respects—it is a forgery, it wasnot painted by El Greco, it is worth quite a bit less atSotheby’s, and so forth. But the forgery is also exactlylike the original in other respects. It is the same shape, size,and weight. The surface of the canvas contains the same arrangementsof colors and shapes—a blue rectangle here, a green swirl there.Indeed, it looks just the same, at least to a single viewerunder identical lighting conditions and so forth. Perhaps it is evenjust as beautiful as the original, though that is morecontroversial., The properties that the forgery is guaranteed to share with theoriginal are those that supervene upon its microphysical properties.Two paintings that are microphysically just alike are guaranteed to bejust alike in the arrangement of colors and shapes on their canvases.That is, you cannot change the arrangement of colors and shapes on apainting’s canvas without changing its microphysical properties.This is just to say that the arrangement of colors and shapessupervenes on its microphysical properties., Supervenience is a central notion in analytic philosophy. It has beeninvoked in almost every corner of the field. For example, it has beenclaimed that aesthetic, moral, and mental properties supervene uponphysical properties. It has also been claimed that modal truthssupervene on non-modal ones, and that general truths supervene onparticular truths. Further, supervenience has been used to distinguishvarious kinds of internalism and externalism, and to test claims ofreducibility and conceptual analysis., Supervenience is related to but distinct from notions like groundingand ontological dependence.  We directly address the relation betweenthese notions in §3.5 (much of that section has been part of thisentry since its initial publication in 2005).},

	abstract = {Ontology is the philosophical inquiry into what exists, and whether or not the phenomenon under consideration exists. The ontology of the future, then, means an examination of the nature and existence of the future. To inquire into the ontology of the future is not to ask “what is the future?” or “what will happen in the future?” but to, instead, consider the nature of the container that is the future. Is the future a kind of container of events? Is it a space that contains all future happenings? If so, this implies that the future already exists, like a distant land toward which we might travel. Perhaps the future is a container that holds only potential occurrences, and is thus not fully in existence. The future might not exist at all, as there are no preexisting occurrences and, thus, nothing to contain such occurrences. The future is a void, and only comes into existence when we experience it, but there is nothing that preexists. The future might already exist because it is a repetition of events that have previously occurred. The goal of the present article is to situate the problem of the ontology of the future within a wider historical context. It has been a commonplace since the Scientific Revolution to view time as linear and the future as an ontologically existent realm linked to past and present. Our understanding of the ontology of the future has a history, meaning that there have been differing ideas about the nature and existence of the future. Generally speaking, how a society understands the shape of time frequently determines how that society views the reality of the future. There is every reason to expect that our view of the nature and actuality of the future will change alongside changes in our understanding of time.},

	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/mctaggart/},
	abstract = {John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart, henceforth simply“McTaggart”, was one of the most important systematicmetaphysicians of the early 20th century. His greatest workis The Nature of Existence, the first volume of which waspublished in 1921 while the second volume was published posthumouslyin 1927 with C.D. Broad as the editor of the manuscript. In addition,he authored many important articles on metaphysics, including hisfamous “The Unreality of Time” in 1908, some of which arecollected in his Philosophical Studies (1934). , McTaggart was also a dedicated interpreter and champion of Hegel, andin addition to many articles on the Hegelian philosophy, he publishedthe following books: Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic (1896,2nd edition printed in 1922), which contains a painstakingdiscussion of the nature of the dialectic as well as the resultsachieved by its means, many of which are conclusions that McTaggartcontinued to argue for throughout his career, including among themthat time is unreal, that existence exhausts reality, that modalnotions cannot be applied to reality as a whole, and that absolutereality contains imperfections; Studies in Hegelian Cosmology(1901, 2nd edition printed in 1918), in which cosmology isunderstood as the discipline that applies a priori conclusions tothose entities and features that we are acquainted with viaexperience, such as selves, the universe, and good and evil, and inwhich topics ranging from the ethical status of punishment and thenature of sin to whether the absolute is a person, whether humanbeings are immortal, or whether Hegel is a Christian are discussed ingreat detail; and A Commentary on Hegel's Logic (1910), whichconsists of a critical commentary on the alleged logical connectionsbetween various categories by which experience must be organized andthe various transitions that lead one from Hegel's category of Beingto the category of Absolute Idea., The extent to which McTaggart's interpretations of Hegel arecorrect is not a matter on which I am competent to determine. For whatit is worth, McTaggart's work on Hegel does not appear to behighly regarded by contemporary scholars of Hegel, insofar as this isreflected in the paucity of references toMcTaggart's interpretations.[1]In what follows, I will spend little time on those works of McTaggartthat occupy themselves with the Hegelian philosophy. This isunfortunate, since this might give the impression that grappling withHegel's philosophy was merely a side project for McTaggart ratherthan a task of much importance for his philosophical development. Inhis Commentary on Hegel's Logic, McTaggart tells us thatthe exposition of Hegel's philosophy has been the chief object ofhis life for the last twenty-one years (Commentary on Hegel's Logic, 311).McTaggart's Hegelianism was alsoimportant for the development of other philosophers such as BertrandRussell, whose early work was inspired by the idealism defended byMcTaggart in his Studies of the Hegelian Dialectic.[3] However, it isworth noting that McTaggart himself later abandoned the dialecticalmethod that he took to be central to Hegel's ownmetaphysics., The plan for this article is as follows. Section 1 will providebiographical information about McTaggart. I will then begin to discussthe central themes of McTaggart's philosophy. Section 2 focuses onMcTaggart's views on the methods of metaphysics. Section 3 discussesMcTaggart's famous argument for the unreality of time.  Section 4 willfocus on McTaggart's philosophy of religion, which was a kind ofatheistic mysticism. Section 5 will focus onMcTaggart's ontological idealism, which is a view akin to theidealism of Leibniz and Berkeley. Section 6 will focus on McTaggart'sposition on what was perhaps the central metaphysical debate of hisperiod, namely, the issue of monism vs.pluralism as well as the concordant issue of the reality ofrelations. Section 7 will be devoted to a smorgasbord of topics ofinterest to contemporary metaphysicians, including McTaggart'sviews on parts and wholes, the distinction between existenceand reality, and questions about essentialism., Section 8 will be the final part of this article, and will focus onMcTaggart's views on ethics. I will discuss McTaggart's views on thenature of intrinsic value, focusing on the questions of to whatontological category the bearers of intrinsic value belong and whatkinds of features determine the intrinsic value of these entities.  Iwill also discuss McTaggart's views on love, the emotion that heaccords the highest place in his ethical system.},

Drawing connections between historical and present-day questions, A Critical Introduction to the Metaphysics of Time provides an up-to-date guide to one of the most central and debated topics in contemporary metaphysics. Introducing the views and arguments of Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Newton and Leibniz, this accessible introduction covers the history of the philosophy of time from the Pre-Socratics to the beginning of the 20th Century. The historical survey presents the necessary background to understanding more recent developments, including McTaggarts 1908 argument for the unreality of time, the open future, the perdurance/endurance debate, the possibility of time travel, and the relevance of current physics to the philosophy of time. Informed by cutting-edge philosophical research, A Critical Introduction to the Metaphysics of Time evaluates influential historical arguments in the context of contemporary developments. For students looking to gain insights into how ideas within the philosophy of time have developed and better understand recent arguments, this is the ideal starting point.},

	shorttitle = {The {Physicist} and the {Philosopher}},
	abstract = {On April 6, 1922, in Paris, Albert Einstein and Henri Bergson publicly debated the nature of time. Einstein considered Bergson's theory of time to be a soft, psychological notion, irreconcilable with the quantitative realities of physics. Bergson, who gained fame as a philosopher by arguing that time should not be understood exclusively through the lens of science, criticized Einstein's theory of time for being a metaphysics grafted on to science, one that ignored the intuitive aspects of time. The Physicist and the Philosopher tells the remarkable story of how this explosive debate transformed our understanding of time and drove a rift between science and the humanities that persists today. Jimena Canales introduces readers to the revolutionary ideas of Einstein and Bergson, describes how they dramatically collided in Paris, and traces how this clash of worldviews reverberated across the twentieth century. She shows how it provoked responses from figures such as Bertrand Russell and Martin Heidegger, and carried repercussions for American pragmatism, logical positivism, phenomenology, and quantum mechanics. Canales explains how the new technologies of the period--such as wristwatches, radio, and film--helped to shape people's conceptions of time and further polarized the public debate. She also discusses how Bergson and Einstein, toward the end of their lives, each reflected on his rival's legacy--Bergson during the Nazi occupation of Paris and Einstein in the context of the first hydrogen bomb explosion. The Physicist and the Philosopher is a magisterial and revealing account that shows how scientific truth was placed on trial in a divided century marked by a new sense of time.},

Science and Technology Studies can play a role in the renewal of this approach. STS is based on a critique of the very same technocratic and scientistic assumptions against which Critical Theory argues. Its critique of positivism and determinism has political implications. But at its origins STS took what Wiebe Bijker called the ‘detour into the academy’ in order to institutionalize itself as a social science. It adopted empirical methods, developed case histories, and limited its scope, avoiding politically controversial issues. Its latent political critique has become explicit in recent years as STS has responded to the rise of technical politics by broadening its concerns. Its wide scope converges with the equally encompassing Critical Theory. Together, STS and Critical Theory offer a new concept of politics.},

In particular, the work examines how the enlightenment values embedded within the culture and materiality of digital technology can be used to explain the changes that are occurring across society.Critical Theory and the Digital draws from the critical concepts developed by critical theorists to demonstrate how the digital needs to be understood within a dialectic of potentially democratizing and totalizing technical power. By relating critical theory to aspects of a code-based digital world and the political economy that it leads to, the book introduces the importance of the digital code in the contemporary world to researchers in the field of politics, sociology, globalization and media studies.},

	title = {Scientific {Explanation}},
	isbn = {978-94-007-6446-0},
	abstract = {When scientist investigate why things happen, they aim at giving an explanation. But what does a scientific explanation look like? In the first chapter (Theories of Scientific Explanation) of this book, the milestones in the debate on how to characterize scientific explanations are exposed. The second chapter (How to Study Scientific Explanation?) scrutinizes the working-method of three important philosophers of explanation, Carl Hempel, Philip Kitcher and Wesley Salmon and shows what went wrong. Next, it is the responsibility of current philosophers of explanation to go on where Hempel, Kitcher and Salmon failed. However, we should go on in a clever way. We call this clever way the pragmatic approach to scientific explanation and clarify briefly what this approach consists in. The third chapter (A Toolbox for Describing and Evaluating Explanatory Practices) elaborates the pragmatic approach by presenting a toolbox for analysing scientific explanation. In the last chapter (Examples of Descriptions and Evaluations of Explanatory Practices) the approach is illustrated with real-life examples of scientists aiming at explaining. This book can be used as a textbook for intermediate philosophy of science courses and is also valuable as “suggested reading” for introductory courses in philosophy of science. The way the book is set up makes it an excellent study and research guide for advanced (MA and PhD) students that work on the topic of scientific explanation. Finally, it is a handy source and reference book for senior researchers in the field of scientific explanations and – more generally – for all philosophers of science. ​},

	isbn = {978-0-8166-5686-8},
	abstract = {From Einstein's quest for a unified field theory to Stephen Hawking's belief that we “would know the mind of God” through such a theory, contemporary science—and physics in particular—has claimed that it alone possesses absolute knowledge of the universe. In a sweeping work of philosophical inquiry, originally published in French in seven volumes, Isabelle Stengers builds on her previous intellectual accomplishments to explore the role and authority of science in modern societies and to challenge its pretensions to objectivity, rationality, and truth. For Stengers, science is a constructive enterprise, a diverse, interdependent, and highly contingent system that does not simply discover preexisting truths but, through specific practices and processes, helps shape them. She addresses conceptual themes crucial for modern science, such as the formation of physical-mathematical intelligibility, from Galilean mechanics and the origin of dynamics to quantum theory, the question of biological reductionism, and the power relations at work in the social and behavioral sciences. Focusing on the polemical and creative aspects of such themes, she argues for an ecology of practices that takes into account how scientific knowledge evolves, the constraints and obligations such practices impose, and the impact they have on the sciences and beyond. This perspective, which demands that competing practices and interests be taken seriously rather than merely (and often condescendingly) tolerated, poses a profound political and ethical challenge. In place of both absolutism and tolerance, she proposes a cosmopolitics—modeled on the ideal scientific method that considers all assumptions and facts as being open to question—that reintegrates the natural and the social, the modern and the archaic, the scientific and the irrational. Cosmopolitics I includes the first three volumes of the original work. Cosmopolitics II will be published by the University of Minnesota Press in Spring 2011.},

	edition = {Winter 2018},
	title = {Process {Philosophy}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/process-philosophy/},
	abstract = {Process philosophy is based on the premise that being is dynamic andthat the dynamic nature of being should be the primary focus of anycomprehensive philosophical account of reality and our place withinit. Even though we experience our world and ourselves as continuouslychanging, Western metaphysics has long been obsessed with describingreality as an assembly of static individuals whose dynamic featuresare either taken to be mere appearances or ontologically secondary andderivative. For process philosophers the adventure of philosophybegins with a set of problems that traditional metaphysicsmarginalizes or even sidesteps altogether: what is dynamicity orbecoming—if it is the way we experience reality, howshould we interpret this metaphysically? Are there several varietiesof becoming—for instance, the uniform going on of activitiesversus the coming about of developments? Do all developments have thesame way of occurring quite independently of what iscoming about? How can we best classify into different kindsof occurrences what is going on and coming about? How can weunderstand the emergence of apparently novel conditions? , While process philosophers insist that all within and about reality iscontinuously going on and coming about, they do not deny that thereare temporally stable and reliably recurrent aspects of reality. Butthey take such aspects of persistence to be the regular behavior ofdynamic organizations that arise due to the continuously ongoinginteraction of processes. In order to articulate a process view ofreality, special theoretical efforts are required, however, since thestandard theoretical tools of Western metaphysics are geared to thestatic view of reality. Especially the standard interpretation ofpredicate logic in terms of static individuals with properties thatare exemplified timelessly or at a temporal instant consolidates whatis from the process-philosophical perspective an unhelpful theoreticalbias. This has forced upon process philosophy a double role asmetaphysical and metaphilosophical enterprise—pushingfor a paradigm change, process philosophy has the double task ofdeveloping new explanatory concepts and providing argumentsfor why these concepts better serve the aims of philosophy., Process philosophy centers on ontology and metaphysics, but it hasfull systematic scope: its concern is with the dynamic sense of beingas becoming or occurrence, the conditions of spatio-temporalexistence, the kinds of dynamic entities, the relationship betweenmind and world, and the realization of values in action. Someapproaches to process philosophy are conceived on the grand scale andoffer a full-scope metaphysics in the form of a systematic theory orcomprehensive philosophical view. Other approaches, especially morerecent ones, take a more modest approach. They pursue the specificproblems that the various philosophical disciplines are engaged inwhile focusing on the dynamic aspects of each sub-domain. Such processontologies, process ethics, process epistemologies, process theoriesof mind etc. are contributions to ‘process philosophy’more broadly conceived as a research paradigm of philosophicalinquiry. They share the guiding idea that natural existence consistsin modes of becoming and types of occurrences.‘Processists’ agree that the world is an assembly ofphysical, organic, social, and cognitive processes that interact atand across levels of dynamic organization. However, within that broadframework, process philosophers debate about how such a world ofprocesses is to be construed, how it relates to the human mind (whichis another process) and how the dynamic nature of reality relates toour scientific theories. In consequence, process philosophers alsodiffer in their view on the role of philosophy itself and in theirchoice of theoretical style., Process philosophy opposes ‘substance metaphysics,’ thedominant research paradigm in the history of Western philosophy sinceAristotle. Substance metaphysics proceeds from theintuition—first formulated by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopherParmenides—that being should be thought of as simple, hence asinternally undifferentiated and unchangeable. Substance metaphysiciansrecast this intuition as the claim that the primary units of reality(called “substances”) must be static—they must bewhat they are at any instant in time. In contrast to thesubstance-metaphysical snapshot view of reality, with its typicalfocus on eternalist being and on what there is, processphilosophers analyze becoming and what is occurring as wellas ways of occurring. In some process accounts, becoming isthe mode of being common to the many kinds of occurrences or dynamicbeings. Other process accounts hold that being is ongoingself-differentiation; on these accounts becoming is both the mode ofbeing of different kinds of dynamic beings and the processthat generates different kinds of dynamic beings. In order to developa taxonomy of dynamic beings (types and modes of occurrences),processists replace the descriptive concepts of substance metaphysicswith a set of new basic categories. Central among these is the notionof a basic entity that is individuated in terms of what it‘does.’ This type of functionally individuated entity isoften labeled ‘process’ in a technical sense of this termthat does not coincide with our common-sense notion of a process. Someof the ‘processes’ postulated by process philosophersare—in agreement with our common-sense understanding ofprocesses—temporal developments that can be analyzed astemporally structured sequences of stages of an occurrence, with eachsuch stage being numerically and qualitatively different from anyother. But some of the ‘processes’ that processphilosophers operate with are not temporal developments in this sense—they are, for example, temporal but non-developmentaloccurrences like activities, or non-spatiotemporal happenings thatrealize themselves in a developmental fashion and therebyconstitute the directionality of time. What holds for all dynamicentities labelled ‘processes,’ however, is that theyoccur—that they are somehow or other intimatelyconnected to time, and often, though not necessarily, related to thedirectionality or the passage of time. , Process philosophers claim that there are many sound philosophicalreasons to take the processual aspects of nature, cognition, andaction as fundamental features of the real. The perhaps most powerfulargument for process philosophy is its wide descriptive or explanatoryscope. If we admit that the basic entities of our world are processes,we can generate better philosophical descriptions of all the kinds ofentities and relationships we are committed to when we reason aboutour world in common sense and in science: from quantum entanglement toconsciousness, from computation to feelings, from things toinstitutions, from organisms to societies, from traffic jams toclimate change, from spacetime to beauty. Moreover, results incognitive science, some philosophers have claimed, show that we need aprocess metaphysics in order to develop a naturalist theory of themind and of normativity. These arguments form the background for theprocessist criticism of the focus on substance in Western philosophy.The bias towards substances seems to be rooted partly in the cognitivedispositions of speakers of Indo-European languages, and partly intheoretical habituation, as the traditional prioritization of staticentities (substances, objects, states of affairs, static structures)at the beginning of Western metaphysics built on itself. In contrast,process philosophy shows fewer affinities to any particular languagegroup and can allude to a rich tradition of reflection in many of thegreat schools of Eastern thought. As recently appeared, processphilosophy also has an increasing practical dimension, since only ifwe re-visualize our world as a system of interactions can we come togrips, conceptually and ethically, with the new phenomena ofartificial life, artificial intelligence, and artificial sociality,and investigate the exceptionality of human capacities and the scopeof moral obligation. Thus contemporary process philosophy holds outthe promise of offering superior support for the three most pressingtasks of philosophy at the beginning of the 21st century. First, itprovides the category-theoretic tools for an integrated metaphysicsthat can join our common sense and scientific images of the world.Second, it can serve as a theoretical platform upon which to build anintercultural philosophy and to facilitate interdisciplinary researchon global knowledge representation by means of an ontologicalframework that is no longer parochially Western. Third, it suppliesconcepts that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration on reflectedtechnology development, and enable the cultural and ethicalimagination needed to shape the expectable deep socio-cultural changesengendered by the increased use of technology, especially automation.},

	abstract = {An informative real-world guide to studying the "why" of human behavior Introduction to Qualitative Research Methods is a practical, comprehensive guide to the collection and presentation of qualitative data. Unique in the market, this book describes the entire research process — from design through writing — illustrated by examples of real, complete qualitative work that clearly demonstrates how methods are used in actual practice. This updated fourth edition includes all new case studies, with additional coverage of mixed methods, non-sociological settings, funding, and a sample interview guide. The studies profiled are accompanied by observation field notes, and the text includes additional readings for both students and instructors. More than just theory, this guide is designed to give you a real-world practitioner's view of how qualitative research is handled every step of the way. Many different disciplines rely on qualitative research as a method of inquiry, to gain an in-depth understanding of human behavior and the governing forces behind it. Qualitative research asks "why" and "how," and the data is frequently complex and difficult to measure. This book shows you how to effectively handle qualitative work, regardless of where it's being applied.  Understand the strengths and limitations of qualitative data Learn how experts work around common methodological issues Compare actual field notes to the qualitative studies they generated Examine the full range of qualitative methods throughout the research process  Whether you're studying sociology, psychology, marketing, or any number of other fields, especially in the social and behavioral sciences, human behavior is the central concern of your work. So what drives human behavior? That's what qualitative research helps to explain. Introduction to Qualitative Research Methods gives you the foundation you need to begin seeking answers.},

Taking into account the costs of these extra investments, we find that the rate of return to such a policy is positive and high. We also find dynamic complementarity of public and private stocks of R\&D for a long period after the initial shock. However, our results also show that the productivity effects on the Dutch economy are weaker when they are part of an internationally concerted policy effort, i.e. when other OECD countries implement policies with the same effects on R\&D stocks in their countries. While complements in the long run equations of the model, in the adjustment process Dutch domestic private R\&D appears to consider foreign public R\&D as a substitute, i.e. when foreign public R\&D rises, Dutch private R\&D tends to shrink.},

	abstract = {One of the most fundamental tasks relating to the undertaking of fieldwork for a qualitative research study lies in "gaining access". This involves both securing entry into a particular organisation and ensuring that individuals associated with it, such as employees or users, will serve as informants. In terms of the first problem, a range of strategies that may be adopted by the investigator is highlighted in this paper. The methods include using endorsements from "authorities", gradually phasing one's entry into the organisation, offering benefits of some kind to managers in the event of their cooperation, responding to gatekeepers' concerns honestly, demonstrating one's suitability for entry in terms of professional background and experience, and remaining receptive to managers' suggestions for the study. To encourage the cooperation of those associated with the organisation, the researcher may well favour a policy of prolonged engagement, seek to blend in with the community, offer incentives where appropriate and acknowledge openly the value of informants' contributions. These strategies are considered in detail. The article also stresses the importance of gaining the approval of any "third parties" that may be responsible for the welfare of those people whom the researcher has targeted as informants.},

	abstract = {Objectives
This study aims to (1) elucidate whether the Hawthorne effect exists, (2) explore under what conditions, and (3) estimate the size of any such effect.

Study Design and Setting
This systematic review summarizes and evaluates the strength of available evidence on the Hawthorne effect. An inclusive definition of any form of research artifact on behavior using this label, and without cointerventions, was adopted.

Results
Nineteen purposively designed studies were included, providing quantitative data on the size of the effect in eight randomized controlled trials, five quasiexperimental studies, and six observational evaluations of reporting on one's behavior by answering questions or being directly observed and being aware of being studied. Although all but one study was undertaken within health sciences, study methods, contexts, and findings were highly heterogeneous. Most studies reported some evidence of an effect, although significant biases are judged likely because of the complexity of the evaluation object.

Conclusion
Consequences of research participation for behaviors being investigated do exist, although little can be securely known about the conditions under which they operate, their mechanisms of effects, or their magnitudes. New concepts are needed to guide empirical studies.},

	abstract = {By the time Umberto Eco published his best-selling novel The Name of the Rose, he was one of Italy's most celebrated intellectuals, a distinguished academic and the author of influential works on semiotics. Some years before that, in 1977, Eco published a little book for his students, How to Write a Thesis, in which he offered useful advice on all the steps involved in researching and writing a thesis -- from choosing a topic to organizing a work schedule to writing the final draft. Now in its twenty-third edition in Italy and translated into seventeen languages, How to Write a Thesis has become a classic. Remarkably, this is its first, long overdue publication in English. Eco's approach is anything but dry and academic. He not only offers practical advice but also considers larger questions about the value of the thesis-writing exercise. How to Write a Thesis is unlike any other writing manual. It reads like a novel. It is opinionated. It is frequently irreverent, sometimes polemical, and often hilarious. Eco advises students how to avoid "thesis neurosis" and he answers the important question "Must You Read Books?" He reminds students "You are not Proust" and "Write everything that comes into your head, but only in the first draft." Of course, there was no Internet in 1977, but Eco's index card research system offers important lessons about critical thinking and information curating for students of today who may be burdened by Big Data. How to Write a Thesis belongs on the bookshelves of students, teachers, writers, and Eco fans everywhere. Already a classic, it would fit nicely between two other classics: Strunk and White and The Name of the Rose. This MIT Press edition will be available in three different cover colors.

Worse still, emphasis by technical experts on physical and logical layer security has lulled civil society into a dangerous torpor that conflates information transmission reliability with reliable information. This has been exploited by criminals, adversarial states such as Russia and hostile non-state actors such as the Islamic State. This article explores the danger of an overly narrow conception of cybersecurity by governments and practitioners and recommends an urgent focus on the social layer toward a holistic rebalancing of cybersecurity. It offers a set of recommendations to help civil society secure itself in cyberspace.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to study whether U.S. cyber strategy is integrated into U.S. grand strategy. In consideration of cyber strategy documents, three case studies and elite interviews find that a link between the two strategic layers is largely missing. Even though U.S. cyber strategy documents contain higher political goals, they do not meet other criteria that indicate links to a grand strategy. Those are a unified list of geopolitical challenges, a balance of ends and means, the integration of military, economic and political means, and the provision of a strategic narrative. Thereby, the documents leave the articulation of grand strategy at the initial stages and do not develop it further. The lack of grand strategy in cyberspace is also visible in U.S. tactical behaviour. The three chosen case studies show that the various U.S. military, economic and political actions taking place under the Obama administration were isolated from each other. Hence, they failed to create a combined impact greater than the sum of their separate effects. This study fills the demonstrated gap in U.S. strategy and concludes by presenting a cyber strategy that is integrated into U.S. grand strategy.},

The threat of it successfully prevented the deployment of a nuclear weapon during and since the United States versus Soviet Union Cold War. It has also prevented the escalation to total warfare scenarios (where countries fully deploy their arsenals and capabilities against each other). Cyber weapons are poised to potentially create more havoc, death and destruction than a single nuclear weapon would and there has been significant contemporary use of information and influence warfare. Given the foregoing, this paper investigates whether mutual assured destruction scenarios may exist which are (or could be) responsible for keeping the use of these warfare methods in check. Further, the paper considers whether the three types of warfare might be effective in holding the others in check.},

New or critical security studies is growing as a field, but still lacks a clear methodology; the diverse range of the main foci of study (culture, practices, language, or bodies) means that there is little coherence or conversation between these four schools or approaches.  In this ground-breaking collection of fresh and emergent voices, new methods in critical security studies are explored from multiple perspectives, providing practical examples of successful research design and methodologies. Drawing upon their own experiences and projects, thirty-three authors address the following turns over the course of six comprehensive sections:   Part I: Research Design   Part II: The Ethnographic Turn   Part III: The Practice Turn   Part IV: The Discursive Turn   Part V: The Corporeal Turn   Part VI: The Material Turn  This book will be essential reading for upper-level students and researchers in the field of critical security studies, and of much interest to students of sociology, ethnography and IR.},

In particular, it focuses on gaining trust and gauging the tone of the interview, how to present oneself during the interview, asking open- and closed-questions, the appropriate length of an interview, whether to record the conversation, coping with difficult scenarios, asking awkward questions, managing respondents who do not answer the question, keeping respondents interested in the interview and finally gaining feedback from respondents.},

In this article, I outline a series of targeted strategies aimed at successfully recruiting members of the political elite for qualitative research, using examples from a successful recruitment process in a study of U.S. state court judges. Recruitment strategies tailored to elite populations are described, including utilizing multiple modes of contact, crafting a compelling presentation of the study, highlighting participation benefits, preemptively alleviating concerns, and elegantly navigating gatekeepers. These techniques extend common recruitment approaches used with non-elite populations to political elites and provide guidance in managing the unique power dynamics associated with accessing members of the elite to improve interview participation rates.},

Adorno auf Einladung des Verbands Sozialistischer Studenten Österreichs an der Wiener Universität einen Vortrag, der aus heutiger Sicht nicht nur von historischem Interesse ist. Vor dem Hintergrund des Aufstiegs der NPD, die bereits in den ersten beiden Jahren nach ihrer Gründung im November 1964 erstaunliche Wahlerfolge einfahren konnte, analysiert Adorno Ziele, Mittel und Taktiken des neuen Rechtsradikalismus dieser Zeit, kontrastiert ihn mit dem »alten« Nazi-Faschismus und fragt insbesondere nach den Gründen für den Zuspruch, den rechtsextreme Bewegungen damals – 20 Jahre nach Kriegsende – bei Teilen der bundesdeutschen Bevölkerung fanden. Vieles hat sich seitdem geändert, manches aber ist gleich geblieben oder heute, 50 Jahre später, wieder da.

Dabei beschreibt er das vielfältige Spektrum der neuen rechten Bewegungen und untersucht die Herkunft und Vernetzung ihrer Kader. Mit seinem kenntnisreichen Blick in die deutsche Geschichte zerschlägt er die zentralen Mythen der Neuen Rechten und zeigt: Gegenwärtig werden nationalistische Strömungen der Vergangenheit, die der Nationalsozialismus verdrängt hatte, wieder aufgegriffen. Volker Weiß geht den autoritären Vorstellungen nach und veranschaulicht Übergänge von Konservativismus, Rechtspopulismus und Rechtsextremismus. Zugleich demaskiert er die antiliberalen Phrasen der Rechten und ihren Gestus als »68er von rechts«. Die frappierende Erkenntnis: »Abendländer« und Islamisten sind in ihrem Kampf gegen Selbstbestimmung Waffenbrüder.

Federico Finchelstein, one of the leading scholars of fascist and populist ideologies, synthesizes their history in order to answer these questions and offer a thoughtful perspective on how we might apply the concepts today. While they belong to the same history and are often conflated, fascism and populism actually represent distinct political and historical trajectories.

The article discusses why the UN GGE process seemed to have now reached a dead-end. It argues that the discussion about how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) should be regulated is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences as it is about law. For the time being, states have too diverging interests and normative preferences for consensus on anything but the most basic of legal ﬁndings to arise. The article also offers some suggestions about what the future holds with regard to the regulation of cyberspace. It argues that the collapse of the UN GGE process is likely to lead to a shift away from ambitious global initiatives and towards regional agreements between “like-minded states”. In turn, we may well see the gradual emergence of a fragmented international normative structure for ICT. It is also likely that nonstate actors will begin to play a more central role in the efforts to bring legal clarity to the governance of ICT.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing literature on cyber security, most studies have sidestepped important questions of how conﬂict escalates in the cyber domain. To better understand this dynamic, we advance two main theoretical pathways of escalation, one in which actors respond with increasing intensity based on the effect of an attack, irrespective of how it is conducted (through cyber, conventional, or nuclear) and another in which the means of attack determines the actor’s willingness to escalate. We then test those effects- and means-based pathways with an original experiment that probes support for escalation, focusing on the American public, a key actor in debates about nuclear escalation and deterrence. Our study suggests that cyberattacks create a threshold that restrains the escalation of conﬂict. Americans are less likely to support retaliation with force when the scenario involves a cyberattack even when they perceive the magnitude of attacks across domains to be comparable. Our ﬁndings provide support for cyber strategies based on assumptions of cyber thresholds, while also casting doubt on the credibility of cyber deterrence by punishment. More broadly, our research suggests effects-based theories of escalation may not help understand the impact of emerging technologies on strategic stability.},

In our experiments, currently used techniques frequently fail to uncover the parameters of the canonical crisis-signaling game, regardless of sample size and number of equilibria in the data generating process. We propose three estimators that remedy these problems, outperforming current best practices. We fit the signaling model to data on economic sanctions. Our solutions find a novel U-shaped relationship between audience costs and the propensity for leaders to threaten sanctions, which current best practices fail to uncover.},

In practice, however, standard-setting efforts are often characterized by repeated interaction and complementarities among technologies. These features give firms that contribute technology to standards both the ability and the incentive to avoid excessive royalties by threatening to exclude other technology contributors from future rounds of standardization if they charge royalties exceeding ‘fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory’ (FRAND) levels.

In this study, the case of the standards war between HD-DVD and Blu-ray was analyzed with patent data as an empirical case considering a dynamic framework. With this framework, we observed a change in a firm’s technology relations and could predict the decline in a firm’s preference and the shift of equilibrium ahead of Toshiba’s resignation.},

	abstract = {Standards play a prominent role in systems characterized by interaction. In information systems, standards provide for compatibility and are a prerequisite for collaboration benefits. More generally speaking, standards constitute networks. In this work, a standardization framework based on an analysis of deficiencies of network effect theory and a game theoretic network equilibrium analysis is developed. Fundamental determinants of diffusion processes in networks (e.g. network topology, agent size, installed base) are identified and incorporated into a computer-based simulation model. As a result, typical network behaviour (specific diffusion patterns) can be explained and many findings from traditional network effect theory can be described as special cases of the model at particular parameter constellations (e.g. low price, high density). On this basis, solution strategies for standardization problems are developed, and a methodological path towards a unified theory of networks is proposed.

This paper bridges the gap by analyzing their interaction (or ‘indirect bargain’) in a dynamic two-sided market. It shows that in the symmetric equilibrium, the classic result that the first-period price is U-shaped in switching costs does not emerge, but instead switching costs always intensify the first-period price competition. Moreover, an increase in switching costs on one side decreases the first-period price on the other side. Policies that ignore these effects may overestimate the extent to which switching costs can reduce welfare.},

Firms face a choice between two modes of competition: make their networks incompatible and compete fiercely for market dominance, or make their networks compatible and have mild competition. By incentivizing firms to harvest their locked-in consumers rather than price aggressively for market dominance, switching costs tip the balance in favor of compatible networks and mild competition. A public policy that reduces switching costs also tends to make networks incompatible, and results in small efficiency gains at best. Combining the policy with a mandatory compatibility policy, however, can lead to sizable efficiency gains.},

	abstract = {New network technologies constantly seek to displace incumbents. Their success depends on technological superiority, the size of the incumbent’s installed base, users’ adoption behaviors, and various other factors. The goal of this paper is to develop an understanding of competition between network technologies, and identify the extent to which different factors, in particular converters (a.k.a. gateways), affect the outcome. Converters can help entrants overcome the inﬂuence of the incumbent’s installed base by enabling cross-technology interoperability. However, they have development, deployment, and operations costs, and can introduce performance degradations and functionality limitations, so that if, when, why, and how they help is often unclear. To this end, the paper proposes and solves a model for adoption of competing network technologies by individual users. The model incorporates a simple utility function that captures key aspects of users’ adoption decisions. Its solution reveals a number of interesting and at times unexpected behaviors, including the possibility for converters to reduce overall market penetration of the technologies and to prevent convergence to a stable state; something that never arises in their absence. The ﬁndings were tested for robustness, e.g., different utility functions and adoption models, and found to remain valid across a broad range of scenarios.},

A country’s soft power rests on its resources of culture, values and policies. A smart-power strategy combines hard- and soft-power resources. Public diplomacy has a long history as a means of promoting a country’s soft power, and soft power was essential in winning the Cold War. Smart public diplomacy requires an understanding of the roles of credibility, self-criticism and civil society in generating soft power. As authoritarian states today use new cyber technologies and other means to disrupt political processes in democracies, questions arise about the boundaries of soft power and the appropriate policies for public diplomacy.},

	abstract = {In theory, a fully functional quantum computer could break the cryptographic protocols that underwrite cybersecurity everywhere, which would be disastrous for national security, global trade, and civil society. Quantum cryptography, conversely, promises an unprecedented level of security, yet this benefit comes with some danger: revisionist actors with impenetrable communications might be able to conduct surprise attacks and covert conspiracies. In reality, neither of these threat scenarios are likely. Intelligence advantage in political competition depends on the interaction of technological infrastructure with organizational institutions. Robust cryptosystems can be undermined by poor organizational coordination, and careful security policy can compensate for technical vulnerabilities. Scientific innovation in quantum technology only affects one of these dimensions while potentially complicating the other. Even if the formidable engineering challenges of quantum computing can be overcome, signals intelligence collectors will still have to analyze a vast number of decrypts and deliver timely and relevant judgments to interested decision makers. The quantum networks of tomorrow, similarly, will provide little protection for complex organizations that have weak operations security practices. In the practice of intelligence, we should expect classical politics to dominate quantum computing.},

Newspaper content analysis represents a common and reliable way to investigate public discourse retrospectively. We thus quantitatively compare broadsheet newspaper coverage about predictive genetic testing in the United Kingdom and Switzerland during the period of 2011–2016 regarding content, evaluations, stakeholder influence, and trigger events. British coverage was more extensive and positive and included more personal stories. Swiss coverage had more focus on political issues. Angelina Jolie’s announcement about her double mastectomy was the most important coverage trigger. Researchers were the most frequently cited stakeholder group, but stakeholders from government and civil society were also represented. Our results thus reflect a movement toward a more active public engagement with predictive genetic testing.

Many people perceive YouTube as a good resource for learning about science, yet viewing many of the available videos can be akin to learning through transmission models, which are considered inferior when they are the sole form of instruction. The goal of this study was to examine whether YouTube's embedded feature of posting (post-video) comments could mitigate these limitations, and offer a potential educative added-value by opening opportunities for discussion and deliberation, which have been associated with deeper learning. Focusing on Science as a target domain, we examined 1530 post-video public comments from a corpus of leading science channels. We coded the comments for argumentative and knowledge construction moves, and tested whether particular moves led to higher-level knowledge construction. Our findings reveal that this informal setting reflected comments that went beyond information sharing to argumentative negotiation, reaching a higher level of knowledge construction, and yielding a greater proportion of such comments that have been found in previous studies within formal settings. This study demonstrates that YouTube can offer an informal space for science deliberation and a forum for collaborative interactions that have a potential to support life-long learning. Implications for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) brings new opportunities and represents a new source of welfare and efficiency. However, the emerging consumer IoT platform competition creates the risk of monopoly power due to network effects. Overall, it is likely that both competition (incentivized through lowering consumer switching costs) and cooperation (achieved through interoperability, which enables data portability and service provider multihoming) are needed to maximize social welfare. This article aims to address how consumer switching costs and provider multihoming affect competition of emerging consumer IoT data platforms under different market conditions and regulatory schemes. It utilizes agent-based modelling that is especially suitable when decision making is distributed at a micro level while some rules are applied in a centralized fashion. The obtained findings emphasize the role of the regulator in guiding the market. It seems that when switching costs diminish at all sides of the platforms, consumers and service providers will favour the platform with a higher number of users. Further, service provider multihoming mitigates market concentration on both sides of a platform when switching costs are low. Thus, there seems to be a minimum level of interoperability needed to promote market competition. Further, although data portability gives more freedom to consumers in choosing a platform provider, it may result in a winner-takes-all situation due to strong indirect network effects.},

In particular, we conducted a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis assessing whether and which anchorages correspond to necessary and/or sufficient conditions for exerting regulatory authority. Our results show that strong anchorage in democratic procedures is specifically relevant for this outcome. Further, we find that weak anchorage in democratically elected politicians leads to high regulatory authority, confirming the significance of non-state actors in this policy field. More generally, our findings support but also qualify expectations about the compatibility and mutual reinforcement of democratic quality and regulatory authority at the transnational level.},

	abstract = {Unconditionally secure communication, being pursued for thousands of years, however, hasn't been reached yet due to continuous competitions between encryption and hacking. Quantum key distribution (QKD), harnessing the quantum mechanical nature of superposition and non-cloning, may promise unconditional security by incorporating the one-time pad algorithm rigorously proved by Claude Shannon. Massive efforts have been made in building practical and commercial QKD systems, in particular, decoy states are employed to detect photon-number splitting attack against single-photon source loophole, and measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD has further closed all loopholes in detection side, which leads to a seemingly real-life application. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an MDI-QKD hacking strategy on the trusted source assumption by using injection locking technique. Eve injects near off-resonance photons in randomly chosen polarization into sender's laser, where injection locking in a shifted frequency can happen only when Eve's choice matches with sender's state. By setting a shifted window and switching the frequency of photons back afterwards, Eve in principle can obtain all the keys without terminating the real-time QKD. We observe the dynamics of a semiconductor laser with injected photons, and obtain a hacking success rate reaching 60.0\% of raw keys. Our results suggest that the spear-and-shield competitions on unconditional security may continue until all potential loopholes are discovered and closed ultimately.},

If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. This Internal Report shares the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, and outlines NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this space. The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.},

In this article, we review and develop the game theoretic literature on kidnapping in order to gain insight on ransomware. The prior literature on kidnapping has largely focused on political or terrorist hostage taking. We demonstrate, however, that key models within the literature can be adapted to give critical new insight on ransomware. We primarily focus on two models. The ﬁrst gives insight on the optimal ransom that criminals should charge. The second gives insight on the role of deterrence through preventative measures. A key insight from both models will be the importance of spillover effects across victims. We will argue that such spillovers point to the need for some level of outside intervention, by governments or otherwise, to tackle ransomware.},

We consider two competing Internet service providers (ISPs), which act as platforms between Internet users and content providers (CPs). One of the ISPs is vertically integrated and provides the other (nonintegrated) ISP with access to its last-mile network. We study the impact of the access price on the termination fees charged by the ISPs to CPs for carrying their trafﬁc. First, we show that the termination fee set by the integrated ISP decreases with the access price, whereas the termination fee of the non-integrated ISP can either increase or decrease with it. Second, we show that there exists a negative relationship (“waterbed effect”) between the access price and the total termination fee paid by the CPs. As a consequence, it may be socially optimal for the regulator to set the access price above cost when termination fees are left to the market.},

During this time, QWERTY has become a controversial issue, because many individuals feel that the sequential keyboard market is being monopolized by a sub-optimum layout. Despite these feelings, in 1971 the International Standards Organization recognized QWERTY as the Standard keyboard, and a year later Alden, Daniels \& Kanarick (1972) concluded that QWERTY was “the de facto Standard layout for Communications and computer interface keyboards”. This article reviews the origins of the QWERTY keyboard, and other sequential keyboards which have been developed since 1909. The reasoning behind the design of these other keyboards and the subsequent impact they made on the keyboard world are discussed. Various explanations are suggested as to why this previous research has not had any effect on the design of the QWERTY keyboard.},

The District Court Judge found in most points for the plaintiffs and ordered the breakup of Microsoft into two companies, one with all the operating systems software, and one with all other products of the company. The District Court also imposed a number of severe restrictions on the business conduct of Microsoft. We analyze the economic issues related to liability. We also analyze the applicability and effectiveness of the remedies imposed by the District Court and contrast them with other potential remedies.},

	abstract = {The expression “Internet of Things” (IoT), coined back in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, the British technology pioneer who cofounded the Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is becoming more and more mainstream. In opening the IoT Week 2013 with a pre-recorded video message, Ashton insisted on the realization that IoT is here now; it is not the future but the present. While Gartner identifies IoT as one of the top ten strategic technology trends, Cisco forecasts 50 billion devices connected by 2020, a potential market in excess of \$14 trillion, and also claims that IoT is actually already here. Similarly, it is not only companies with a technological focus, such as Ericsson, Bosch or Siemens that use IoT to advertise their cutting edge technologies – media companies such as the BBC are conducting research activities and have plans for IoT deployment. In short, we are currently on the verge of witnessing the emergence of a “mega-market”, where markets such as home and building automation, electricity generation and distribution, logistics, automotive, as well as telecommunications and information technology will steadily converge. As yet, we do not know the consequences of connecting all of these smart objects (smart meter, e-vehicle, cargo container, fridge etc.) to the Internet.},

The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

In focus of this paper are open issues and challenges considered from the technological perspective. Just for clarification, we put in light different visions that stand behind this paradigm in order to facilitate a better understanding of the IoT's features. Furthermore, this exhaustive survey provides insights into the state-of-the-art of IoT enabling and emerging technologies. The most relevant among them are addressed with some details. The main scope is to deliver a comprehensive overview of open issues and challenges to be tackled by future research.

	abstract = {Cybersecurity has steadily crept to the top of the national security agenda. Simultaneously, a merger of the physical and virtual worlds is noticeably underway. A confluence of technologies has come together to make this possible under the rubric known as the Internet of Things (IoT). This merger will bring sensors and computing devices totaling in the billions to connect objects together in a network that does not require human intervention, along with which will come much vaunted benefits, knowable risks, uncertainties and considerable security dilemmas. Using the past as a predictor of future behavior, a vast increase in hackable devices will create equally vast vulnerabilities that will now touch the physical world. Yet the IoT will also present opportunities that are just now being imagined, likely making the Internet revolution seem small by comparison. While technological growth often appears to outpace policy, government retains the power to convene and ultimately to regulate. This article examines why policymakers should care about the IoT, the significant trends for the next five to ten years, and likely security implications stemming from those trends.

Design/methodology/approach The paper demonstrates the centrality of internet connectivity to any definition of cyberspace and to cybersecurity, which clarifies the way internet governance and cybersecurity governance are interdependent. Drawing on classic notions of a security dilemma, the paper also argues for distinguishing between national cybersecurity and societal cybersecurity. Findings Major structural features of the governance problem in cybersecurity and internet governance are analogous. Joint production of internet services and cybersecurity makes them heavily interdependent. This means that cybersecurity governance and internet governance models need to be compatible, and the approach we take to one will influence how we approach the other. Originality/value The interdependence of cybersecurity governance and internet governance has not been carefully examined before, and the relationship is not well understood. These two strands of thinking about cyberspace governance have not been properly connected. This paper bridges the gap and makes policymakers more aware of the potential tensions between a cybersecurity perspective and an internet governance perspective.},

High-profile controversies include the disclosures about NSA surveillance by intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, controversy over a decision by the US government to relinquish its historic oversight of Internet names and numbers, and countless cybersecurity breaches involving unauthorized access to Internet users' personal data. Much of the Internet governance ecosystem-both technical architecture and coordinating institutions-is behind the scenes but increasingly carries significant public interest implications. An area once concealed in institutional and technological complexity is now rightly bracketed among other shared global issues-such as environmental protection and human rights-that have considerable global implications but are simply incongruous with national borders.

This article provides a concise up-to-date review of QKD, biased toward the practical side. Essential theoretical tools that have been developed to assess the security of the main experimental platforms are presented (discrete-variable, continuous-variable, and distributed-phase-reference protocols).},

	abstract = {Key establishment is a crucial primitive for building secure channels in a multi-party setting. Without quantum mechanics, key establishment can only be done under the assumption that some computational problem is hard. Since digital communication can be easily eavesdropped and recorded, it is important to consider the secrecy of information anticipating future algorithmic and computational discoveries which could break the secrecy of past keys, violating the secrecy of the confidential channel.Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used generate secret keys that are secure against any future algorithmic or computational improvements. QKD protocols still require authentication of classical communication, although existing security proofs of QKD typically assume idealized authentication. It is generally considered folklore that QKD when used with computationally secure authentication is still secure against an unbounded adversary, provided the adversary did not break the authentication during the run of the protocol.We describe a security model for quantum key distribution extending classical authenticated key exchange (AKE) security models. Using our model, we characterize the long-term security of the BB84 QKD protocol with computationally secure authentication against an eventually unbounded adversary. By basing our model on traditional AKE models, we can more readily compare the relative merits of various forms of QKD and existing classical AKE protocols. This comparison illustrates in which types of adversarial environments different quantum and classical key agreement protocols can be secure.},

Photons appear to be the medium of choice for quantum communication. Owing to photon losses, robust quantum communication over long lossy channels requires quantum repeaters. It is widely believed that a necessary and highly demanding requirement for quantum repeaters is the existence of matter quantum memories. Here we show that such a requirement is, in fact, unnecessary by introducing the concept of all-photonic quantum repeaters based on flying qubits. In particular, we present a protocol based on photonic cluster-state machine guns and a loss-tolerant measurement equipped with local high-speed active feedforwards. We show that, with such all-photonic quantum repeaters, the communication efficiency scales polynomially with the channel distance. Our result paves a new route towards quantum repeaters with efficient single-photon sources rather than matter quantum memories.},

	abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD)1–3 is a theoretically secure way of sharing secret keys between remote users. It has been demonstrated in a laboratory over a coiled optical fibre up to 404 kilometres long4–7. In the field, point-to-point QKD has been achieved from a satellite to a ground station up to 1,200 kilometres away8–10. However, real-world QKD-based cryptography targets physically separated users on the Earth, for which the maximum distance has been about 100 kilometres11,12. The use of trusted relays can extend these distances from across a typical metropolitan area13–16 to intercity17 and even intercontinental distances18. However, relays pose security risks, which can be avoided by using entanglement-based QKD, which has inherent source-independent security19,20. Long-distance entanglement distribution can be realized using quantum repeaters21, but the related technology is still immature for practical implementations22. The obvious alternative for extending the range of quantum communication without compromising its security is satellite-based QKD, but so far satellite-based entanglement distribution has not been efficient23 enough to support QKD. Here we demonstrate entanglement-based QKD between two ground stations separated by 1,120 kilometres at a finite secret-key rate of 0.12 bits per second, without the need for trusted relays. Entangled photon pairs were distributed via two bidirectional downlinks from the Micius satellite to two ground observatories in Delingha and Nanshan in China. The development of a high-efficiency telescope and follow-up optics crucially improved the link efficiency. The generated keys are secure for realistic devices, because our ground receivers were carefully designed to guarantee fair sampling and immunity to all known side channels24,25. Our method not only increases the secure distance on the ground tenfold but also increases the practical security of QKD to an unprecedented level.},

	abstract = {We introduce Recursive Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) and Recursive Simple Stochastic Games (RSSGs), which are classes of (finitely presented) countable-state MDPs and zero-sum turn-based (perfect information) stochastic games. They extend standard finite-state MDPs and stochastic games with a recursion feature. We study the decidability and computational complexity of these games under termination objectives for the two players: one player's goal is to maximize the probability of termination at a given exit, while the other player's goal is to minimize this probability. In the quantitative termination problems, given an RMDP (or RSSG) and probability p, we wish to decide whether the value of such a termination game is at least p (or at most p); in the qualitative termination problem we wish to decide whether the value is 1. The important 1-exit subclasses of these models, 1-RMDPs and 1-RSSGs, correspond in a precise sense to controlled and game versions of classic stochastic models, including multitype Branching Processes and Stochastic Context-Free Grammars, where the objective of the players is to maximize or minimize the probability of termination (extinction). We provide a number of upper and lower bounds for qualitative and quantitative termination problems for RMDPs and RSSGs. We show both problems are undecidable for multi-exit RMDPs, but are decidable for 1-RMDPs and 1-RSSGs. Specifically, the quantitative termination problem is decidable in PSPACE for both 1-RMDPs and 1-RSSGs, and is at least as hard as the square root sum problem, a well-known open problem in numerical computation. We show that the qualitative termination problem for 1-RMDPs (i.e., a controlled version of branching processes) can be solved in polynomial time both for maximizing and minimizing 1-RMDPs. The qualitative problem for 1-RSSGs is in NP ∩ coNP, and is at least as hard as the quantitative termination problem for Condon's finite-state simple stochastic games, whose complexity remains a well known open problem. Finally, we show that even for 1-RMDPs, more general (qualitative and quantitative) model-checking problems with respect to linear-time temporal properties are undecidable even for a fixed property.},

These behaviors may range from rational and payoff-maximizing strategies to rules that mimic heuristics identified by cognitive science. Agent-based techniques can be applied in isolation to create high-fidelity models and to explore new questions using simple constructions. They can also be used as a complement to deductive techniques. Overall, ABMs offer the potential to advance social sciences and to help us better understand our complex world.},

We consider a regulation under which firms are not allowed to produce if they were found in noncompliance with the preset emissions standard during the government’s imperfect inspection. In the case of the ex ante monopoly, a loose standard coupled with an intensive inspection effectively induces perfect compliance. In the case of the ex ante duopoly, the intensified inspection directly creates market entry barriers, but it also induces firms to increase abatement investments for better environmental compliance, which indirectly promotes market competition. Moreover, a firm invests more in pollution abatement if it is initially cleaner or more production-efficient than its rival, or if it has fewer potential rival. We also find that regulatory tightening may harm social welfare by reducing the probability of entry, and social welfare may be higher under monopoly than under duopoly when government inspection is sufficiently intensive.},

The results show that the increase of network scale reduces the speed of knowledge transfer in the network, and the greater the average cooperation intensity of the nodes, the higher the evolution depth of knowledge transfer. Compared with university-research institutes, the evolution depth of knowledge transfer in enterprises is higher, and with the increase of network scale, the gap between the evolution depth of knowledge transfer between them is gradually increasing. Only when reward, punishment and synergistic innovation benefits are higher than the cost of knowledge transfer that can promote the benign evolution of industry-university-research cooperation innovation networks. Only when the knowledge transfer coefficient and the knowledge reorganization coefficient exceed a certain threshold will knowledge transfer behavior emerge in the network. With the increase of the knowledge transfer coefficient and the knowledge reorganization coefficient, the knowledge transfer evolutionary depth of the average cooperation intensity of all kinds of nodes is gradually deepening.},

Global trade liberalization is modeled as an iterated prisoner’s dilemma between all possible pairs of WTO member states. Empirical data are used to model the sizes and competitiveness of the respective markets, which then determine the resulting gains and costs of trade cooperation. Because of the large number of WTO member states and repeated rounds of their interactions, we use computer simulations to calculate the strategies that lead to the maximum ‘fitness’ of the respective member states and consequently diffuse through the population of countries. The results of our simulations show that international trade cooperation is not a stable equilibrium and that extreme levels of trade liberalization can be exploited successfully by protectionist trade policies.},

	abstract = {Is the Internet erasing national borders? Will the future of the Net be set by Internet engineers, rogue programmers, the United Nations, or powerful countries? Who's really in control of what's happening on the Net? In this provocative new book, Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu tell the fascinating story of the Internet's challenge to governmental rule in the 1990s, and the ensuing battles with governments around the world. It's a book about the fate of one idea―that the Internet might liberate us forever from government, borders, and even our physical selves. We learn of Google's struggles with the French government and Yahoo's capitulation to the Chinese regime; of how the European Union sets privacy standards on the Net for the entire world; and of eBay's struggles with fraud and how it slowly learned to trust the FBI. In a decade of events the original vision is uprooted, as governments time and time again assert their power to direct the future of the Internet. The destiny of the Internet over the next decades, argue Goldsmith and Wu, will reflect the interests of powerful nations and the conflicts within and between them. While acknowledging the many attractions of the earliest visions of the Internet, the authors describe the new order, and speaking to both its surprising virtues and unavoidable vices. Far from destroying the Internet, the experience of the last decade has lead to a quiet rediscovery of some of the oldest functions and justifications for territorial government. While territorial governments have unavoidable problems, it has proven hard to replace what legitimacy governments have, and harder yet to replace the system of rule of law that controls the unchecked evils of anarchy. While the Net will change some of the ways that territorial states govern, it will not diminish the oldest and most fundamental roles of government and challenges of governance. Well written and filled with fascinating examples, including colorful portraits of many key players in Internet history, this is a work that is bound to stir heated debate in the cyberspace and globalization communities.},

This phenomenon has not yet been characterized because it is infeasible to find a large and geographically diverse set of clients in China from which to test connectivity. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by using a hybrid idle scan technique that is able to measure connectivity between a remote client and an arbitrary server, neither of which are under the control of the researcher performing measurements. In addition to hybrid idle scans, we present and employ a novel side channel in the Linux kernel’s SYN backlog. We show that both techniques are practical by measuring the reachability of the Tor network which is known to be blocked in China. Our measurements reveal that failures in the firewall occur throughout the entire country without any conspicuous geographical patterns.We give some evidence that routing plays a role, but other factors (such as how the GFW maintains its list of IP/port pairs to block) may also be important.},

Boson sampling is such a task and is considered as a strong candidate to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. We perform Gaussian boson sampling by sending 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer with full connectivity and random matrix—the whole optical setup is phase-locked—and sampling the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. The obtained samples are validated against plausible hypotheses exploiting thermal states, distinguishable photons, and uniform distribution. The photonic quantum computer generates up to 76 output photon clicks, which yields an output state-space dimension of 1030 and a sampling rate that is {\textasciitilde}1014 faster than using the state-of-the-art simulation strategy and supercomputers.},

Recently, there have been substantial developments in the field of patent analytics, which describes the science of analysing large amounts of patent information to discover trends. We define Intellectual Property Analytics (IPA) as the data science of analysing large amount of IP information, to discover relationships, trends and patterns for decision making. In this paper, we contribute to the ongoing discussion on the use of intellectual property analytics methods, i.e artificial intelligence methods, machine learning and deep learning approaches, to analyse intellectual property data. This literature review follows a narrative approach with search strategy, where we present the state-of-the-art in intellectual property analytics by reviewing 57 recent articles. The bibliographic information of the articles are analysed, followed by a discussion of the articles divided in four main categories: knowledge management, technology management, economic value, and extraction and effective management of information. We hope research scholars and industrial users, may find this review helpful when searching for the latest research efforts pertaining to intellectual property analytics.},

These projects aim to move away from the traditional host-centric networks and replace them with content-centric, mobilitycentric, or service-centric networks. However, different principles and designs also raise various issues on network security. For each project, we describe its architecture design and how it deals with security issues.

	abstract = {Emerging technology drives technological development and innovation in diverse fields of technology. Emerging technology forecasting can predict the possible areas of emerging technology. However, it is difficult to forecast the emerging technology because most technology forecasting tasks depend on the subjective experience of experts. Patent analysis is an objective method to recognize the trends in technological development. Many patent analysis methods have been researched; these methods apply text mining techniques to analyze the text data of patent documents such as the title and abstract. This approach has some limitations, namely the computing cost and information loss associated with the preprocessing step of text mining. Therefore, we propose a new patent information analysis to overcome these problems. Using the International Patent Classification codes from the patent documents of a target technology, we construct an emerging technology forecasting model. This research combines statistical inference and neural networks to construct our model for new patent information analysis. We perform a case study to verify how our research can be practically applied, using nanotechnology as the target technology. Therefore, we contribute this research to R\&D planning.},

Specifically, our work analyses the inventor citations and examiner citations of both international- and domestic-granted patents in SIPO from four different aspects: citations per patent, foreign citation dependence, highly cited patents and current impact index. Our research results indicate the following: (a) the quantity of citations per patent added by foreign applicants was much larger than that of the Chinese applicants in SIPO, and both decreased year after year. (b) Chinese applicants cited many technological references from seven major foreign countries and drew greatly from external technology and science, but Chinese applicants tended to refer more to domestic technology. (c) The overall impact of Chinese patents became stronger, but invention patents in some developed regions had only relatively weak technological impact. (d) The number of high-quality invention patents surged in every province, but high-quality patents remain mainly distributed in four developed areas.

	abstract = {The rapid pace of technological advances creates many difficulties for R\&amp;D practitioners in analyzing emerging technologies. Patent information analysis is an effective tool in this situation. Conventional patent information analysis has focused on the extraction of vacant, promising, or core technologies and the monitoring of technological trends. From a technology management perspective, the ultimate purpose of R\&amp;D is technology commercialization. The core of technology commercialization is the technology transfer phase. Although a great number of patents are filed, publicized, and registered every year, many commercially relevant patents are filtered through registration processes that examine novelty, creativity, and industrial applicability. Despite the efforts of these selection processes, the number of patents being transferred is low when compared with total annual patent registrations. To deal with this problem, this study proposes a predictive model for technology transfer using patent analysis. In the predictive model, patent analysis is conducted to reveal the quantitative relations between technology transfer and a range of variables included in the patent data.},

Second, logistic substitution models in the context of long-term technological forecasting are reviewed. Third, some hypotheses about how to improve the reliability of the logistic substitution model for studying the technological future are proposed.},

Regarding criticisms and failures reported in the literature to apply logistic function for long-term forecasting, in our work we focused on short-term accuracy of forecast. To formulate the model, based on mathematical approximation, at first the differential equation governing the diffusion process is found and then by solving the derived differential equation, the forecast function is obtained. In all steps, mathematical tools from numerical analysis are used. We compared the New Generalized Logistic Model with eight of the most renowned models in the literature. The model led to more accurate fits and forecasts than those obtained from other models we applied for comparison.},

	abstract = {Global economic integration is driving countries and companies to increasingly pursue internationalized innovation activities. During this process, transnational patents are thought to play a vital role in protecting inventions and innovations abroad. This study investigates the structure of international technology diffusion and its evolution using transnational patent networks (TPNs) during the 1994–2017 period. The analyses are conducted using topological structures, centrality rankings, a three-layer visualization analysis (global, contextual and ego) and a block modeling analysis assisted by measures from social network analysis. The major findings are as follows: (1) TPNs present clear small-world phenomena, and the countries in the networks tend to establish more connections with other countries over time; (2) TPNs exhibit a highly uneven distribution in degree centrality and betweenness centrality, indicating a conspicuous global hierarchical structure of patent-expanding capabilities in various countries; (3) three-layer landscapes of TPNs illustrate the extreme imbalance in the ability of expanding transnational patents between South and North countries; (4) four blocks that play different roles in TPNs are distinguished, i.e., source, broker, beginner and absorber; and (5) 22 countries with high betweenness rankings achieve block-level transitions; among these countries, China and Singapore are highly typical examples. This paper argues that developed countries are actively using the monopoly power granted by transnational patents to shape a new world system. This study concludes with a discussion of policy implications for developing countries.},

Several reports have analysed specific aspects of China’s AI policies or have assessed the country’s technical capabilities. Instead, in this article, we focus on the socio-political background and policy debates that are shaping China’s AI strategy. In particular, we analyse the main strategic areas in which China is investing in AI and the concurrent ethical debates that are delimiting its use. By focusing on the policy backdrop, we seek to provide a more comprehensive and critical understanding of China’s AI policy by bringing together debates and analyses of a wide array of policy documents.},

Thereby, the intelligence agencies generate norms for the rest of the international community. Yet, they remain under the international regulation radar for being sub-state entities.

	abstract = {This policy brief covers the behaviour of intelligence agencies in cyberspace and possible normative constraints on that behaviour. Most known cyber operations by intelligence agencies are so called ‘below-the-threshold’ operations, and some stretch beyond what is commonly understood to be ‘foreign intelligence gathering’ to include covert action and influence campaigns. The digital domain facilitates new possibilities for classic intelligence tasks, but also entails new risks and (un)intended consequences such as threats to civilian use of the internet and grey zones of accountability. Importantly, the operations of intelligence services in cyberspace can have a negative impact on international peace and stability. In terms of regulation, intelligence agencies are the proverbial elephants in the room when states discuss the applicability of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to the online world. The military-dominated legal framework does not fit well with actual state practice in cyberspace. States are reluctant to discuss the specific operations of their intelligence agencies. This trend is unlikely to halt.In order to explore the role of foreign intelligence agencies in cyberspace and the (im)possibilities of oversight and regulation thereof, we convened 15 experts in a workshop in The Hague in April 2019. The experts were all from Europe and North America and about half of the participants were (former) members of foreign intelligence agencies, both civilian and military. The other participants were academic experts and members of intelligence oversight bodies. The workshop was held under the Chatham House rule. This brief incorporates findings from the workshop, and is based in the broader research agenda of The Hague Program for Cyber Norms.},

	abstract = {The world is waiting for the first quantum computers, which are expected to revolutionize computing. Their unprecedented power may also enable them to crack the digital encryption system upon which the modern information and communication infrastructure depends. By breaking that encryption, quantum computing could jeopardize secure communications, financial transactions, and the support system for the global economy. The authors of this report explore those risks by assessing, first, how quickly quantum computers are likely to be developed; second, how quickly encryption that can withstand attacks by quantum computers, or postquantum cryptography (PQC), is likely to be standardized; and third, how quickly and widely PQC will be adopted. The analysis concludes that the threat to the security of the modern communications infrastructure is urgent but manageable, and the authors offer recommendations to the U.S. government for responding. There is already a race among nations and corporations attempting to develop quantum computers (primarily in the United States, China, and the European Union), and many expected commercial applications are unrelated to cryptography. Quantum computers capable of undermining current cryptography are likely at least a decade off, but they are already introducing risks, and these risks will grow over time. To assess these timelines and associated risk, the authors undertook a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature review, a review of expert opinion, and a broad consumer survey to assess the likely events, risks, and uncertainties and recommend appropriate policies and risk-mitigation actions.},

Boson-sampling is a non-universal quantum computer that is significantly more straightforward to build than any universal quantum computer proposed so far. We begin this chapter by motivating boson-sampling and discussing the history of linear optics quantum computing. We then summarize the boson-sampling formalism, discuss what a sampling problem is, explain why boson-sampling is easier than linear optics quantum computing, and discuss the Extended Church-Turing thesis. Next, sampling with other classes of quantum optical states is analyzed. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of building a boson-sampling device using existing technology.},

	abstract = {There is a large body of evidence for the potential of greater computational power using information carriers that are quantum mechanical over those governed by the laws of classical mechanics. But the question of the exact nature of the power contributed by quantum mechanics remains only partially answered. Furthermore, there exists doubt over the practicality of achieving a large enough quantum computation that definitively demonstrates quantum supremacy. Recently the study of computational problems that produce samples from probability distributions has added to both our understanding of the power of quantum algorithms and lowered the requirements for demonstration of fast quantum algorithms. The proposed quantum sampling problems do not require a quantum computer capable of universal operations and also permit physically realistic errors in their operation. This is an encouraging step towards an experimental demonstration of quantum algorithmic supremacy. In this paper, we will review sampling problems and the arguments that have been used to deduce when sampling problems are hard for classical computers to simulate. Two classes of quantum sampling problems that demonstrate the supremacy of quantum algorithms are BosonSampling and Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time Sampling. We will present the details of these classes and recent experimental progress towards demonstrating quantum supremacy in BosonSampling.},

However, to achieve the IoT paradigm’s main goal, which is to deliver efficient and high-quality smart services, interoperation among various IoT standards is necessary. Therefore, interoperability and quality of service (QoS) provisioning are two of the main requirements for current and future standards operating within the IoT ecosystem. To understand how current standards can or cannot meet these requirements, first, we analyze high-level technical standards for some application domains within the IoT ecosystem. Second, with a focus on some common communication network standards, we present the QoS requirements of smart services in the IoT. Finally, we highlight the mechanisms employed by these standards in enabling interoperability and QoS in the IoT environment.},

Current statistical models of strategic choice based on perfect Bayesian equilibrium, however, allow for very little, if any, belief updating. I explain why current models allow for little updating and offer in their stead a new, fully strategic choice estimator that calculates the correct amount of belief updating.},

	abstract = {Costly signaling offers a solution to many foreign policy dilemmas. Though most commonly studied in the context of the bargaining theory of war, signaling can also play an important role in nonzero-sum interactions such as those characterized by chicken (e.g., nuclear deterrence) and the prisoner’s dilemma (e.g., tariff reductions). A rich game theoretic literature explains how actors can signal credibly in these situations. The most prominent strategies are sinking costs (actions that are costly ex ante) or tying hands (actions that are costly ex post). These strategies are theoretically elegant but have generated considerable controversy when studied empirically. One controversy concerns the existence of hand-tying domestic audience costs under different regime types. A second controversy involves the degree to which sinking costs increase or decrease the risk of war. These controversies speak to the inherent tension between theories of strategic interactions and measuring their outcomes in the foreign policy process, where some events are off the equilibrium path and thus unobserved.
            The limited availability of foreign policy data was a major hindrance in earlier empirical efforts. Even as the quality of this data has improved, focus has been on the outcomes of conflict (crisis onset, escalation to war, victory, defeat) rather than the strategy. This is problematic given that all crises are sequential in nature and understanding the action–reaction cycle is vital to illuminating patterns of war, capitulation, and settlement. The frontier of research in the signaling literature is in bridging this gap. The advent of big data and machine learning has enabled more systematic empirical analysis of strategic moves by various foreign policy actors, including signaling. Some researchers, such as Lindsay \& Gartzke, are harnessing these new data and methods to explore the means of signaling. Other scholars are beginning to ask questions about the efficacy of public versus private signaling, the role of ambiguity, and dyadic versus multi-actor signaling. This new wave of research seeks to nudge signaling closer to the concerns of foreign policy practitioners.},

Bringing together leading scholars in the field, it features an impressive breadth and depth of coverage of the different theoretical approaches to the study of security and the ever-evolving range of issues that dominate the security agenda in the 21st Century.  Throughout the text, students are encouraged to question their own preconceptions and assumptions, and to use their own judgement to critically evaluate key approaches and ideas. To help them achieve this, each chapter is punctuated with helpful learning features including 'key ideas', 'think points' and case studies, demonstrating the real world applications and implications of the theory.  In addition to covering a wide range of topical security issues, from terrorism and inter-state armed conflict to cybersecurity, health, and transnational crime, the fourth edition features a new chapter on postcolonialism and expanded coverage of critical security studies.

	abstract = {There is an underlying assumption in the social sciences that consciousness and social life are ultimately classical physical/material phenomena. In this ground-breaking book, Alexander Wendt challenges this assumption by proposing that consciousness is, in fact, a macroscopic quantum mechanical phenomenon. In the first half of the book, Wendt justifies the insertion of quantum theory into social scientific debates, introduces social scientists to quantum theory and the philosophical controversy about its interpretation, and then defends the quantum consciousness hypothesis against the orthodox, classical approach to the mind-body problem. In the second half, he develops the implications of this metaphysical perspective for the nature of language and the agent-structure problem in social ontology. Wendt's argument is a revolutionary development which raises fundamental questions about the nature of social life and the work of those who study it.},

The analysis is a product of collaboration over the past four years between the two authors, one a scholar of international relations, the other a therapeutic practitioner with training in medical physics. Our focus is the conceptual claim that ‘seeing’ breaks an entanglement rather than the experiment itself. The first section explores a broad contrast between classical and quantum measurement, asking what this might mean at the macroscopic level. The second section categorizes Wendt’s claim about language as a form of expressive measurement and explores the relationship to discourse analysis. The third section explores the broad contours of our experiment and the role of a somewhat different form of non-linear expressive measurement. In the final section, we elaborate the relationship between redemptive measurement and breaking an entanglement, which involves a form of ‘seeing’ that witnesses to unacknowledged past trauma.},

They are inherently dualistic in that they combine the properties of abstract numbers with the properties of owned objects. As a result of this duality at its core, the money system exhibits the properties of a macroscopic quantum system, including entanglement, indeterminacy and interference, with money objects playing a special role as a measurement device. This article argues that, by virtue of its dualistic nature, money acts as a vector of transmission that scales up the properties of quantum mind to the global level. By bringing money back into the picture and providing an alternative to the mechanistic vision of mainstream economics, quantum social science promises to change the way we see and treat the economy, with implications for international relations and security.},

Adopting the latter view, I compare and contrast hype cycles with threat inflation and securitization theory. I then sketch my own theoretical propositions about technology hype as being common in national security, with variable degrees of acceptance, familiar content, and significant consequences. A case study on quantum technologies provides proof of concept. I find ample evidence of hype over quantum computers, communications, and sensors; audience acceptance in the national security community varies with familiarity; and consequential decisions appear to follow. While cyclical expectations suggest the need for caution when citing quantum technologies in support of quantum approaches to international relations, a middle-range theory about technology hype provides useful insight into security practice.},

We then introduce measures of patent and citation biases. When aggregated at the firm level, these survive popular methods of adjustment and are correlated with firm-level characteristics. We show that these issues can lead to problematic – and ex ante predictable –inferences, using several examples from prominent streams of finance literature that use patent data.

The source of this information is the bibliographic and classification data associated with each patent. much of which is required by law and hence is extremely accurate. These data serve to fingerprint the increment of technological activity disclosed in a patent. Possible ways of using the data include: — identification of emerging technologies — Monotoring foreign activity — identification of “actors” in the technology — tracking applications and impacts of a technology The objective of the technology assessment and forecast program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office is to stimulate the use of the patent file of the Office. The Office of Technology Assessment and Forecast (OTAF), which administers the program has assembled a master data base covering all U.S. patents. It periodically updates this base and adds new data items to it.
Résumé
On ne se rend pas souvent compte de la richesse des informations contenues dans les brevets et de leur utilité, entre autres, pour les autorités fixant des politiques et les directions d'entreprises. La source de ces informations provient des données bibliographiques et de la classification concernant chaque brevet; la plupart de ces données est exigée par la loi et, par conséquent, trés exacte. Ces données servent à exprimer l'accroissement technologique révélé par un brevet. Les possibilités d'utilisation des données comportent: — l'identification des technologies naissantes — le contrôle de l'activité étrangére — l'identification des {\textless}{\textless}acteurs{\textgreater}{\textgreater} dans une technologie — le dépistage des demandes de brevet et des facteurs influançant une technologie. L'object du programme de l'US-Patent and Trademark Office dans le domaine de l'évaluation et de la prévision technologique est de stimuler l'utilisation de l'ensemble des brevets de l'Office. Le bureau de l'evaluation et de la prévision technologique (OTAF), chargé de son exécution, a établi des données maîtresses de base couvrant tous les brevents américains. Ces données sont réguliérement mises á jour complétées par nouvelles sortes de données.
Zusammenfassung
Es wird häufig der Reichtum an Informationen in Patenten übersehen, welche z.B. für politiksetzende öffentliche Körperschaften und für das Firmenmanagement von Nutzen sind. Die Quelle dieser Informationen sind die mit jedem Patent verbundenen bibliographischen und klassificatorischen Daten, von denen viele gesetzlich vorgeschrieben und daher äusserts akkurat sind. Diese dienen dazu, den in einem Patent offenbarten technologischen Zuwachs genau auszudrücken. Möglichkeiten zur Nutzung der Daten umfassen: — Ermittlung neu entstehender Technologien — Ueberwachung der ausländischen Aktivitäten — Ermittlung der ,,Aktoren “im Technologiebereich — Spurenverfolgung von Anmeldungen und Einfluβgroβen einer Technologie. Ziel des Programmes des US-Patent und Trademark Office im Bereich der Technologiebewertung und -vorausschau ist es, die Nutzung des Patentbestandes des Amtes zu stimulieren. In Vollzug dieser Mission hat das Büro für Technologiebewertung und -vorausschau, welsches das Programm durchführt, eine Grunddatenbasis aufgebaut, welche alle US-Patente enthält. Die Basis wird periodisch auf neuesten Stand gebracht und mit neuen Datenarten vervollständigt.},

	abstract = {International crises are modeled as a political "war of attrition" in which state leaders choose at each moment whether to attack, back down, or escalate. A leader who backs down suffers audience costs that increase as the public confrontation proceeds. Equilibrium analysis shows how audience costs enable leaders to learn an adversary's true preferences concerning settlement versus war and thus whether and when attack is rational. The model also generates strong comparative statics results, mainly on the question of which side is most likely to back down. Publicly observable measures of relative military capabilities and relative interests prove to have no direct effect once a crisis begins. Instead, relative audience costs matter: the side with a stronger domestic audience (e.g., a democracy) is always less likely to back down than the side less able to generate audience costs (a nondemocracy). More broadly, the analysis suggests that democracies should be able to signal their intentions to other states more credibly and clearly than authoritarian states can, perhaps ameliorating the security dilemma between democratic states.},

Carrots, Sticks, and Sermons proposes such a framework for the field and clearly shows how public policy instruments are classified, packaged, and chosen, while highlighting the role evaluation plays in the instruments-choice process.Carrots, Sticks, and Sermons offers a comprehensive analysis of categories and typologies of policy instruments. It classifies sticks, carrots, and sermons - or, more specifically, regulation, economic means, and information. Readers are offered a comparative perspective of evaluation practice in foreign contexts. Special attention is paid to the examples of Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, England, Canada, the United States, and the Republic of Korea. As such, this volume crosses language barriers that stand in the way of dispersing research results among the international community of theoreticians and practitioners. As nations become increasingly interdependent, problems of implementation and evaluation of policy choices will become issues of increasing gravity.Carrots, Sticks, and Sermons provides insights into the traditional and current practice of policy and program evaluation in various contexts. The book's theory of comparative public policy will produce understanding and guidance in designing better policies. It will be of wide interest to those in the fields of public policy, particularly policy design, policy implementation, policy evaluation, comparative politics, and economics.},

While originating in criminal behavior, their impact are also influenced by the decisions of legitimate end users. Getting agents in the Internet, and in networks in general, to invest in and deploy security features and protocols is a challenge, in particular because of economic reasons arising from the presence of network externalities.
In this paper, we focus on the question of incentive alignment for agents of a large network towards a better security. We start with an economic model for a single agent, that determines the optimal amount to invest in protection. The model takes into account the vulnerability of the agent to a security breach and the potential loss if a security breach occurs. We derive conditions on the quality of the protection to ensure that the optimal amount spent on security is an increasing function of the agent's vulnerability and potential loss. We also show that for a large class of risks, only a small fraction of the expected loss should be invested.
Building on these results, we study a network of interconnected agents subject to epidemic risks. We derive conditions to ensure that the incentives of all agents are aligned towards a better security. When agents are strategic, we show that security investments are always socially inefficient due to the network externalities. Moreover alignment of incentives typically implies a coordination problem, leading to an equilibrium with a very high price of anarchy.},

	abstract = {The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework has rapidly become a widely accepted approach to facilitating cybersecurity risk management within organizations. An insightful aspect of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is its explicit recognition that the activities associated with managing cybersecurity risk are organization specific. The NIST Framework also recognizes that organizations should evaluate their cybersecurity risk management on a cost–benefit basis. The NIST Framework, however, does not provide guidance on how to carry out such a cost–benefit analysis. This article provides an approach for integrating cost–benefit analysis into the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Gordon–Loeb (GL) Model for cybersecurity investments is proposed as a basis for deriving a cost-effective level of spending on cybersecurity activities and for selecting the appropriate NIST Implementation Tier level. The analysis shows that the GL Model provides a logical approach to use when considering the cost–benefit aspects of cybersecurity investments during an organization’s process of selecting the most appropriate NIST Implementation Tier level. In addition, the cost–benefit approach provided in this article helps to identify conditions under which there is an incentive to move to a higher NIST Implementation Tier.},

	abstract = {The question of governance of the Internet is increasing in significance. The United Nations' World Summit on the Information Society, held in two phases in 2003 and 2005, provoked heated debate, and the resultant meetings of the Internet Governance Forum that followed this have been the subject of growing public and media interest. Yet governance of the Internet is multifaceted, complex, and far from transparent, and there has been little written about the subject which is detailed, systematic, and non-polemical. This book focuses on the issues involved in the ongoing development of Internet governance, and the challenges associated with developing and applying governance structures at a global level based on bottom-up, consensus-seeking decision-making procedures, without direct foundation in a treaty frame-work. Leading academics and practitioners studying and working in the area of Internet governance explore such issues as how the engineering of infrastructure matters, how legitimacy is gained and retained by governance organizations, and whether elements of such organizations can provide a model for other organizations to emulate. They examine the tensions inherent in Internet governance, such as government control versus digital libertarianism; commercialism versus civil society ideals; interests of developed countries versus interests of developing countries. The book will be of interest to academics, researchers, and students of Information and Communications Technology, legal aspects of ICT, and Organization Studies, as well as legal practitioners, government bodies, NGOs, and others concerned with Internet governance.},

Humans are inferior to robots in warfare and this paper will discuss historical examples in which humans exercised poor judgment in battle or were incapable of deciding due to the effects of combat. Humans are more expensive than robots and this paper show the economic benefits of employing LAWS. As a superpower, the US needs to develop and employ LAWS to establish international norms and be prepared to propose international agreements. The US is one of two countries that has a policy regarding LAWS and it is vague and over five years old. This paper describes the other countries that are currently developing and employing LAWS. Removing the human from the loop is an under represented argument because of legitimate concerns to include lowering the bar to entry to war, violating human dignity, and hacking. This study explores and ultimately refutes these concerns. Ultimately, the most important reason why LAWS should be adopted is that they will save lives.},

Do autonomous weapons raise unique ethical questions for warfare, with implications for just war theory? This essay describes and assesses the ongoing debate, focusing on the ethical implications of whether autonomous weapons can operate effectively, whether human accountability and responsibility for autonomous weapon systems are possible, and whether delegating life and death decisions to machines inherently undermines human dignity. The concept of LAWS is extremely broad and this essay considers LAWS in three categories: munition, platforms, and operational systems.},

While there has not been a global regime banning this technology, regulatory attempts at establishing a ban have intensified along with acts of resistance and blocking coalitions. This article aims to reflect on the prospects and limitations, as well as the ethical and legal intensity, of the emerging regulatory framework. To allow for such an investigation, a power-analytical approach to studying international security regimes is utilized.},

Scientists and business leaders, from Stephen Hawking to Elon Musk, recently signed a letter urging the world to ban autonomous weapons. Part of the argument against these systems is that they violate the public conscience provision of the Martens Clause due to public opposition, making them illegal under international law. What, however, does the US public think of these systems? Existing research suggests widespread US public opposition, but focused on support for autonomous weapons in a vacuum. This paper uses two survey experiments to test the conditions in which public opposition rises and falls. The results demonstrate that public opposition to autonomous weapons is contextual. Fear of other countries or non-state actors developing these weapons makes the public significantly more supportive of developing them. The public also becomes much more willing to actually use autonomous weapons when their use would protect US forces. Beyond contributing to ongoing academic debates about casualty aversion, the microfoundations of foreign policy, and weapon systems, these results suggest the need for modesty when making claims about how the public views new, unknown technologies such as autonomous weapons.},

Protecting this model of global governance in this context has been referred to by the US and EU as ‘essential’ to the future of the Internet. Bringing together actors from the private sector, the public sector and also civil society, multi-stakeholder Internet governance is not only regarded by many as the best way to organise around this particular issue, it is also held up as a potential template for the management of other ‘post-state’ issues. However, as a consequence of its normative aspirations to representation and power sharing, the multi-stakeholder approach to global Internet governance has received little critical attention. This paper examines the issues of legitimacy and accountability with regard to the ‘rule-makers’ and ‘rule-takers’ in this model and finds that it can also function as a mechanism for the reinforcement of existing power dynamics.},

Cybersecurity, geopolitical tensions, and calls for data sovereignty have made many believe that the Internet is fragmenting.In this incisive new book, Milton Mueller argues that the “fragmentation” diagnosis misses the mark. The rhetoric of “fragmentation” camouflages the real issue: the attempt by governments to align information flows with their jurisdictional boundaries. The fragmentation debate is really a power struggle over the future of national sovereignty. It pits global governance and open access against the traditional territorial institutions of government. This conflict, the book argues, can only be resolved through radical institutional innovations. Will the Internet Fragment? is essential reading for students and scholars of media and communications, international relations, political science and STS, as well as anyone concerned about the quality of Internet governance.},

	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/1373114},
	doi = {10.2307/1373114},
	abstract = {Two years ago, an entity called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was formed to take control of the Internet's infrastructure of domain name and IP address identifiers. Private parties formed ICANN at the behest of the U. S. government; the government is currently using its considerable resources to cement ICANN's authority over the domain name space. ICANN's role is one generally played in our society by public entities. It is setting rules for an international communications medium of surpassing importance. That task had historically been performed by a U. S. government contractor in an explicitly public-regarding manner. ICANN is addressing important public policy issues. Further, it is implementing some of its choices via means that look uncannily like command-and-control regulation. If ICANN is to establish its legitimacy, it must be able to answer the charge that its exercise of authority is inconsistent with our ordinary understandings about public power and public policymaking. In developing structures, procedures, and rhetoric to establish its own legitimacy, ICANN has drawn on techniques that parallel the justifications historically offered to defend the legitimacy of the unelected federal administrative agency. First, it has invoked what one might call the techniques of administrative law: it has, in important respects, structured itself so that it looks like a classic U. S. administrative agency, using and purportedly bound by the tools of bureaucratic rationality. Yet the techniques of administrative law are inadequate in this context, for they do not provide meaningful constraint in the absence of judicial review. In the administrative agency context, it is judicial review for rationality and statutory faithfulness that drives the agency's own commitment to process and rationality. But there is no ICANN institution that performs the function that judicial review performs for administrative agencies. Second, ICANN has invoked the techniques of representation: it has adopted structures and procedures that make it resemble a representative (that is to say, elective) government body. ICANN's election of new at-large directors, as this Article goes to press, including candidates who campaigned on a platform of skepticism and reform, is heartening. Yet the task of representation is hardly straightforward. There may be no way to craft an elective mechanism that ensures that the immensely heterogeneous Internet community is represented, in any real sense, within ICANN's structure. Although elections can broaden the set of communities given a voice within ICANN's halls, they cannot render ICANN into a reflection of the Internet community. They can improve ICANN's decisionmaking, but they cannot reliably aggregate the preferences of the Internet world at large, and thus tell ICANN whether to adopt a disputed policy. Finally, ICANN has invoked the techniques of consensus: it has asserted that its structure and rules ensure that it can only act in ways that reflect the consensus of the Internet community. But this is illusory. ICANN does not have procedures that would enable it to recognize consensus, or the lack of consensus, surrounding any given issue. It has commonly taken actions with no clear showing of consensus in the community at large, and its methods of determining that a particular action is supported by consensus have often seemed opaque. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that the issues over which ICANN seeks to exercise authority are ones around which any genuine consensus can be formed.},

In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references’ references) together with the technicalities of the patents (e.g., language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations.},

This fascination builds on networks' descriptive appeal, and descriptions of networks play a prominent role in recent forays into network analysis. For some time, quantitative research has included node-level measures of network characteristics in standard regression models, thereby incorporating network concepts into familiar models. This approach represents an early advance for the literature but may (a) ignore fundamental theoretical contributions that can be found in a more structurally oriented network perspective, (b) focus attention on superficial aspects of networks as they feed into empirical work, and (c) present the network perspective as a slight tweak to standard models that assume complete independence of all relevant actors. We argue that network analysis is more than a tweak to the status quo ante; rather, it offers a means of addressing one of the holy grails of the social sciences: effectively analyzing the interdependence and flows of influence among individuals, groups, and institutions.},

	abstract = {This article provides an introductory summary to the formulation and application of exponential random graph models for social networks. The possible ties among nodes of a network are regarded as random variables, and assumptions about dependencies among these random tie variables determine the general form of the exponential random graph model for the network. Examples of different dependence assumptions and their associated models are given, including Bernoulli, dyad-independent and Markov random graph models. The incorporation of actor attributes in social selection models is also reviewed. Newer, more complex dependence assumptions are briefly outlined. Estimation procedures are discussed, including new methods for Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We foreshadow the discussion taken up in other papers in this special edition: that the homogeneous Markov random graph models of Frank and Strauss [Frank, O., Strauss, D., 1986. Markov graphs. Journal of the American Statistical Association 81, 832–842] are not appropriate for many observed networks, whereas the new model specifications of Snijders et al. [Snijders, T.A.B., Pattison, P., Robins, G.L., Handock, M. New specifications for exponential random graph models. Sociological Methodology, in press] offer substantial improvement.},

Its aim is to set Kant's still influential ethics in its historical context by showing in detail what the central questions in moral philosophy were for him and how he arrived at his own distinctive ethical views. The book is organised into four main sections, each exploring moral philosophy by discussing the work of many influential philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In an epilogue the author discusses Kant's view of his own historicity, and of the aims of moral philosophy. In its range, in its analyses of many philosophers not discussed elsewhere, and in revealing the subtle interweaving of religious and political thought with moral philosophy, this is an unprecedented account of the evolution of Kant's ethics.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning is a state-of-the-art technique to make inference on extensive or complex data. As a black box model due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, Deep Neural Networks are often criticized to be non-transparent and their predictions not traceable by humans. Furthermore, the models learn from artificial datasets, often with bias or contaminated discriminating content. Through their increased distribution, decision-making algorithms can contribute promoting prejudge and unfairness which is not easy to notice due to lack of transparency. Hence, scientists developed several so-called explanators or explainers which try to point out the connection between input and output to represent in a simplified way the inner structure of machine learning black boxes. In this survey we differ the mechanisms and properties of explaining systems for Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision tasks. We give a comprehensive overview about taxonomy of related studies and compare several survey papers that deal with explainability in general. We work out the drawbacks and gaps and summarize further research ideas.},

Today, emerging military technologies—including unmanned aerial vehicles, directed-energy weapons, lethal autonomous robots, and cyber weapons—raise the prospect of upheavals in military practice so fundamental that they challenge assumptions underlying long-established international laws of war, particularly those relating to the primacy of the state and the geographic bounds of warfare. But the laws of war have been developed over a long period, with commentary and input from many cultures. What would seem appropriate in this age of extraordinary technological change, the author concludes, is a reconsideration of the laws of war in a deliberate and focused international dialogue that includes a range of cultural and institutional perspectives.},

	abstract = {The possibility that today?s drones could become tomorrow?s killer robots has attracted the attention of people around the world. Scientists and business leaders, from Stephen Hawking to Elon Musk, recently signed a letter urging the world to ban autonomous weapons. Part of the argument against these systems is that they violate the public conscience provision of the Martens Clause due to public opposition, making them illegal under international law. What, however, does the US public think of these systems? Existing research suggests widespread US public opposition, but focused on support for autonomous weapons in a vacuum. This paper uses two survey experiments to test the conditions in which public opposition rises and falls. The results demonstrate that public opposition to autonomous weapons is contextual. Fear of other countries or non-state actors developing these weapons makes the public significantly more supportive of developing them. The public also becomes much more willing to actually use autonomous weapons when their use would protect US forces. Beyond contributing to ongoing academic debates about casualty aversion, the microfoundations of foreign policy, and weapon systems, these results suggest the need for modesty when making claims about how the public views new, unknown technologies such as autonomous weapons.},

	abstract = {Autonomous weapons systems (AWSs) pose many challenges in complex battleﬁeld environments. Previous discussions of them have largely focused on technological or policy issues. In contrast, we focus here on the challenge of trust in an AWS. One type of human trust depends only on judgments about the predictability or reliability of the trustee, and so are suitable for all manner of artifacts. However, AWSs that are worthy of the descriptor “autonomous” will not exhibit the required strong predictability in the complex, changing contexts of war. Instead, warﬁghters need to develop deeper, interpersonal trust that is grounded in understanding the values, beliefs, and dispositions of the AWS. Current acquisition, training, and deployment processes preclude the development of such trust, and so there are currently no routes for a warﬁghter to develop trust in an AWS. We thus survey three possible changes to current practices in order to facilitate the type of deep trust that is required for appropriate, ethical use of AWSs.},

	abstract = {The intersection between the U.S. military and technological innovation, a “military-innovation nexus,” has led to the genesis of key technologies, including nuclear energy, general computing, GPS, and satellite technology from World War II to the present. However, an evolving innovation context in the twenty-first century, including the leadership of the commercial sector in technology innovation and the resurgence of great power competition, has led to doubts about the ability of the Department of Defense to discover and promote the technological innovations of the future. The Third Offset Strategy was formulated in 2014 in response to these concerns: The offset strategy promulgated reforms to bring the Pentagon and the commercial sector closer together while creating alternative contracting mechanisms for streamlined procurement and prototyping. Using defense biometrics and artificial intelligence as case studies of spinon innovations adopted by the military, this Article seeks to understand the efficacy of the reforms undertaken under the auspices of the Third Offset Strategy to improve the institutional underpinnings of the U.S. innovation system for national security. I argue that the Third Offset Strategy has allowed the Pentagon to more effectively procure, develop, and field commercial technologies in the twenty-first century, and I conclude by proposing modest recommendations for the successful acquisition of spin-on innovations.},

In this so-called Internet of things―connecting everything from cars to cardiac monitors to home appliances―there is no longer a meaningful distinction between physical and virtual worlds. Everything is connected. The social and economic benefits are tremendous, but there is a downside: an outage in cyberspace can result not only in loss of communication but also potentially in loss of life.   Control of this infrastructure has become a proxy for political power, since countries can easily reach across borders to disrupt real-world systems. Laura DeNardis argues that the diffusion of the Internet into the physical world radically escalates governance concerns around privacy, discrimination, human safety, democracy, and national security, and she offers new cyber-policy solutions. In her discussion, she makes visible the sinews of power already embedded in our technology and explores how hidden technical governance arrangements will become the constitution of our future.},

We elaborate expectations for ties’ multilevel embeddedness based on network theory and substantive considerations and explore them using a multilevel ERGM.

	abstract = {Statistical models for social networks have enabled researchers to study complex social phenomena that give rise to observed patterns of relationships among social actors and to gain a rich understanding of the interdependent nature of social ties and actors. Much of this research has focused on social networks within medium to large social groups. To date, these advances in statistical models for social networks, and in particular, of Exponential-Family Random Graph Models (ERGMS), have rarely been applied to the study of small networks, despite small network data in teams, families, and personal networks being common in many fields. In this paper, we revisit the estimation of ERGMs for small networks and propose using exhaustive enumeration when possible. We developed an R package that implements the estimation of pooled ERGMs for small networks using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), called “ergmito”. Based on the results of an extensive simulation study to assess the properties of the MLE estimator, we conclude that there are several benefits of direct MLE estimation compared to approximate methods and that this creates opportunities for valuable methodological innovations that can be applied to modeling social networks with ERGMs.},

Do autonomous weapons raise unique ethical questions for warfare, with implications for just war theory? This essay describes and assesses the ongoing debate, focusing on the ethical implications of whether autonomous weapons can operate effectively, whether human accountability and responsibility for autonomous weapon systems are possible, and whether delegating life and death decisions to machines inherently undermines human dignity. The concept of LAWS is extremely broad and this essay considers LAWS in three categories: munition, platforms, and operational systems.},

In order to obtain a thorough knowledge of security in future Internet architecture, we review a number of well-known projects, including named data networking, Content Aware Searching Retrieval and sTreaming, MobilityFirst Future Internet Architecture Project (MobilityFirst), eXpressive Internet Architecture, and scalability, control, and isolation on next-generation network. These projects aim to move away from the traditional host-centric networks and replace them with content-centric, mobilitycentric, or service-centric networks. However, different principles and designs also raise various issues on network security. For each project, we describe its architecture design and how it deals with security issues. Furthermore, we compare these projects and discuss their pros and cons. Open security issues are pointed out for directing future research.},

The two types of efforts complement each other and positively influence the payoff of the contest. We assume that legal effort affects the prize value, increasing the winner’s prospective rents, and research effort impacts the probability of winning the contest. The results of the model break new ground in showing that research effort is a function of legal effort, wherein research effort increases with rent-seeking effort. The model also shows the existence of a strategic equivalence between rent seeking and patent races.},

	abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) brings new opportunities and represents a new source of welfare and efficiency. However, the emerging consumer IoT platform competition creates the risk of monopoly power due to network effects. Overall, it is likely that both competition (incentivized through lowering consumer switching costs) and cooperation (achieved through interoperability, which enables data portability and service provider multihoming) are needed to maximize social welfare. This article aims to address how consumer switching costs and provider multihoming affect competition of emerging consumer IoT data platforms under different market conditions and regulatory schemes. It utilizes agent-based modelling that is especially suitable when decision making is distributed at a micro level while some rules are applied in a centralized fashion. The obtained findings emphasize the role of the regulator in guiding the market. It seems that when switching costs diminish at all sides of the platforms, consumers and service providers will favour the platform with a higher number of users. Further, service provider multihoming mitigates market concentration on both sides of a platform when switching costs are low. Thus, there seems to be a minimum level of interoperability needed to promote market competition. Further, although data portability gives more freedom to consumers in choosing a platform provider, it may result in a winner-takes-all situation due to strong indirect network effects.},

The dynamic game is described by an Evolutionary Algorithm, which is shown to extend the applicability of ordinary replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory to problem sets characterized by ﬁnite populations and continuous strategy spaces. We analyze the learning process of purely and impurely altruistic agents and ﬁnd in both cases the contribution level to converge towards the Nash equilibrium. The group size, the degree of initial heterogeneity and the propensity to experiment are key factors of the learning process.},

It offers a unifying framework for studying various valuation concepts, from the Shapley value (symmetric as well as weighted) to the different notions of values introduced by Weber [1988]. Using the decomposition of the characteristic function used by Shapley [1953] to prove uniqueness of his value, the idea of Harsanyi was to associate to each coalition a dividend to be distributed among its members to define an allocation. Many authors have contributed to that question. Here, we offer a synthesis of their work, with a particular attention to restrictions on dividend distributions, starting with the seminal contributions of Vasil'ev [1978], Hammer, Peled and Sorensen [1977] and Derks, Haller and Peters [2000], until the recent paper of van den Brink, van der Laan and Vasil'ev [2014].},

	abstract = {In theory, a fully functional quantum computer could break the cryptographic protocols that underwrite cybersecurity everywhere, which would be disastrous for national security, global trade, and civil society. Quantum cryptography, conversely, promises an unprecedented level of security, yet this benefit comes with some danger: revisionist actors with impenetrable communications might be able to conduct surprise attacks and covert conspiracies. In reality, neither of these threat scenarios are likely. Intelligence advantage in political competition depends on the interaction of technological infrastructure with organizational institutions. Robust cryptosystems can be undermined by poor organizational coordination, and careful security policy can compensate for technical vulnerabilities. Scientific innovation in quantum technology only affects one of these dimensions while potentially complicating the other. Even if the formidable engineering challenges of quantum computing can be overcome, signals intelligence collectors will still have to analyze a vast number of decrypts and deliver timely and relevant judgments to interested decision makers. The quantum networks of tomorrow, similarly, will provide little protection for complex organizations that have weak operations security practices. In the practice of intelligence, we should expect classical politics to dominate quantum computing.},

In particular, the toolbox provides functions to compute the (pre-)kernel, (pre-)nucleolus, and anti (pre-)kernel as well as game values like the Banzhaf, Myerson, Owen, position, Shapley, solidarity, and coalition solidarity value and much more. In addition, we will discuss how one can use Matlab’s Parallel Computing Toolbox in connection with this toolbox to beneﬁt from a gain in performance by launching supplementary Matlab workers.

Using cybersecurity research as empirical site, it is shown that two separate ways of understanding cybertechnologies are prevalent in society. The primary one sees cybertechnologies as apolitical, flawed, material objects that need to be fixed in order to create more security; the other understands them as mere political tools in the hands of social actors without considering technological (im)possibilities. This article suggests a focus on a third understanding to bridge the uneasy gap between the two others: technology defined as an embodiment of societal knowledge. The article posits that in line with that, the study of cyberpolitics would benefit from two innovations: a focus on cybersecurity as social practice―enacted and stabilized through the circulation of knowledge about vulnerabilities―and a focus on the practices employed in the discovery, exploitation and removal of those vulnerabilities.},

A central proposition of IPT is that the 'domestic' and the 'international' cannot be treated as self-contained spheres, although this does not preclude states and the states-system from being regarded by some practitioners of IPT as central points of reference.00This Handbook provides an authoritative account of the issues, debates, and perspectives in the field, guided by two basic questions concerning its purposes and methods of inquiry. First, how does IPT connect with real world politics? In particular, how does it engage with real world problems, and position itself in relation to the practices of real world politics? And second, following on from this, what is the relationship between IPT and empirical research in international relations?

The threat of it successfully prevented the deployment of a nuclear weapon during and since the United States versus Soviet Union Cold War. It has also prevented the escalation to total warfare scenarios (where countries fully deploy their arsenals and capabilities against each other). Cyber weapons are poised to potentially create more havoc, death and destruction than a single nuclear weapon would and there has been signiﬁcant contemporary use of information and inﬂuence warfare. Given the foregoing, this paper investigates whether mutual assured destruction scenarios may exist which are (or could be) responsible for keeping the use of these warfare methods in check. Further, the paper considers whether the three types of warfare might be eﬀective in holding the others in check.},

	url = {https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/journals/cadaad/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/05-Lee.pdf},
	abstract = {Discourses on lethal drone operations in the twenty-first century have commonly focused on the physical effects of drone strikes – usually by the CIA – on populations and individuals, and on associated disputes over the legitimacy of such actions. Until now, the secrecy surrounding drone programmes has excluded the perspective of serving military drone operators from public and academic debate. Drawing on both public discourse and interviews with Royal Air Force Reaper drone personnel, this paper explores two ways in which the identity of the drone operator is formed and self-created. Identity formed through other-representation in public discourse is contrasted with elements of identity as practice in the operators’ own discourse. Foucault identified the objectivizing of the subject as a means by which an individual’s identity is constituted in discourse, while also highlighting technologies of the self that are used when the individual’s identity is self-created (Foucault and Rabinow 1997: 224-5). Further, Foucault’s self-forming ethical subject emerges in two ontologically distinct but entwined trajectories: first, in relation to socially or culturally accepted rules, laws, prohibitions and interdictions, which he calls the moral code; and second, through practices of the self (1984: 5, 25). Drawing on Foucault, this paper provides new insight into the actions and identities of British Reaper drone operators, recognizing the previously-unseen, complex and creative ethical dynamics at work in individuals who routinely take decisions and actions that have life or death consequences.},

The article discusses why the UN GGE process seemed to have now reached a dead-end. It argues that the discussion about how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) should be regulated is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences as it is about law. For the time being, states have too diverging interests and normative preferences for consensus on anything but the most basic of legal findings to arise. The article also offers some suggestions about what the future holds with regard to the regulation of cyberspace. It argues that the collapse of the UN GGE process is likely to lead to a shift away from ambitious global initiatives and towards regional agreements between “like-minded states”. In turn, we may well see the gradual emergence of a fragmented international normative structure for ICT. It is also likely that nonstate actors will begin to play a more central role in the efforts to bring legal clarity to the governance of ICT.},

Created by the extensive input of government ofﬁcials decades ago with heavy focus on states as primary actors of international politics, international law is incoherent with the dominance of non-state actors as de facto operators of cyberspace. The critical problem shared by international law and institutions of having no “teeth” to penalize nonstate violence extends to cyberspace. As a result, noncompliance with international law has become practical, and it has even bolstered the private sector, especially major technology ﬁrms, to assert themselves in the legal void, leverage their digital products to reshape norms, and become norm entrepreneurs in the business of digital defense. However, the multiplication of norm entrepreneurs has accelerated in an uncoordinated manner, and the way they built their interests does not neatly align with those of the states. While some norms of cyberspace behavior have been accepted, many others remain contested. In the meantime, norm discourse in diplomatic venues, including in multilateral debates at the United Nations, has become highly undemocratic, dominated by a small mix of great powers and active middle powers that are also split over what norms should guide state and nonstate behaviors.},

We refer to theories in which one or more groups of agents (“coalitions”) deliberately get together to jointly determine withingroup actions, while interacting noncooperatively across groups. The chapter describes a variety of solution concepts, using an umbrella model that adopts an explicit real-time approach. Players band together, perhaps disband later and re-form in shifting alliances, all the while receiving payoffs at each date according to the coalition structure prevailing at the time. We use this model to nest two broad approaches to coalition formation, one based on cooperative game theory, the other based on noncooperative bargaining. Three themes that receive explicit emphasis are agent farsightedness, the description of equilibrium coalition structures, and the efficiency implications of the various theories.},

For each class, we explained in details the fundamental properties, discussed the main solution concepts, and provided an in-depth analysis of the methodologies and approaches for using these games in both game theory and communication applications. The presented applications have been carefully selected from a broad range of areas spanning a diverse number of research problems. The tutorial also sheds light on future opportunities for using the strong analytical tool of coalitional games in a number of applications. In a nutshell, this article fills a void in existing communications literature, by providing a novel tutorial on applying coalitional game theory in communication networks through comprehensive theory and technical details as well as through practical examples drawn from both game theory and communication application.},

Coalitions ﬁght for a prize that is assumed to be subject to rivalry, so its value is non-increasing in the size of the group that obtains it. This formulation encompasses as particular cases some models proposed in the rent-seeking literature. We show that the formation of groups generates positive spillovers and analyze two classes of games of coalition formation. A contest among individual agents is the only stable outcome when individual defections leave the rest of the group intact. More concentrated coalition structures, including the grand coalition, are stable when groups collapse after a defection, provided that rivalry is not too strong. Results in a sequential game of coalition formation suggest that there exists a non-monotonic relationship between the level of underlying rivalry and the level of social conﬂict.},

The contributors to this book have worked in a variety of field locations and settings and have interviewed a wide array of informants, from government officials to members of rebel movements and victims of wartime violence, from lobbyists and corporate executives to workers and trade unionists. The authors encourage scholars from all subfields of political science to use interviews in their research, and they provide a set of lessons and tools for doing so. The book addresses how to construct a sample of interviewees; how to collect and report interview data; and how to address ethical considerations and the Institutional Review Board process. Other chapters discuss how to link interview-based evidence with causal claims; how to use proxy interviews or an interpreter to improve access; and how to structure interview questions. A useful appendix contains examples of consent documents, semistructured interview prompts, and interview protocols. Contributors: Frank R.

However the computational difficulty of ERGM parameter estimation has limited the practical application of this class of models to relatively small networks, up to a few thousand nodes at most, with usually only a few hundred nodes or fewer. In the case of undirected networks, snowball sampling can be used to find ERGM parameter estimates of larger networks via network samples, and recently published improvements in ERGM network distribution sampling and ERGM estimation algorithms have allowed ERGM parameter estimates of undirected networks with over one hundred thousand nodes to be made. However the implementations of these algorithms to date have been limited in their scalability, and also restricted to undirected networks. Here we describe an implementation of the recently published Equilibrium Expectation (EE) algorithm for ERGM parameter estimation of large directed networks. We test it on some simulated networks, and demonstrate its application to an online social network with over 1.6 million nodes.},

	abstract = {With the growth of interest in network data across fields, the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) has emerged as the leading approach to the statistical analysis of network data. ERGM parameter estimation requires the approximation of an intractable normalizing constant. Simulation methods represent the state-of-the-art approach to approximating the normalizing constant, leading to estimation by Monte Carlo maximum likelihood (MCMLE). MCMLE is accurate when a large sample of networks is used to approximate the normalizing constant. However, MCMLE is computationally expensive, and may be prohibitively so if the size of the network is on the order of 1,000 nodes (i.e., one million potential ties) or greater. When the network is large, one option is maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE). The standard MPLE is simple and fast, but generally underestimates standard errors. We show that a resampling method---the parametric bootstrap---results in accurate coverage probabilities for confidence intervals. We find that bootstrapped MPLE can be run in 1/5th the time of MCMLE. We study the relative performance of MCMLE and MPLE with simulation studies, and illustrate the two different approaches by applying them to a network of bills introduced in the United State Senate.},

However, statistical models in R have diverse object structures and summary methods, which makes this process cumbersome. This article ﬁrst develops a set of guidelines for converting statistical model output to LATEX and HTML tables, then assesses to what extent existing packages meet these requirements, and ﬁnally presents the texreg package as a solution that meets all of the criteria set out in the beginning. After providing various usage examples, a blueprint for writing custom model extensions is proposed.},

	abstract = {Causal inference is a fast-growing multidisciplinary field that has drawn extensive interests from statistical sciences and health and social sciences. In this article, we gather comprehensive information on publications and citations in causal inference and provide a review of the field from the perspective of citation network analysis. We provide descriptive analyses by showing the most cited publications, the most prolific and the most cited authors, and structural properties of the citation network. Then, we examine the citation network through exponential random graph models (ERGMs). We show that both technical aspects of the publications (e.g., publication length, time and quality) and social processes such as homophily (the tendency to cite publications in the same field or with shared authors), cumulative advantage, and transitivity (the tendency to cite references’ references), matter for citations. We also provide specific analysis of citations among the top authors in the field and present a ranking and clustering of the authors. Overall, our article reveals new insights into the landscape of the field of causal inference and may serve as a case study for analyzing citation networks in a multidisciplinary field and for fitting ERGMs on big networks. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {The implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) is central to what the World Economic Forum has coined the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’; a technological revolution built upon cyberphysical systems that will blur the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres. Novel interconnections will emerge as a result, challenging traditional relations and modes of governance. However, a central feature of the IoT is that the implications of cyber (in)security are no longer abstract. The IoT also returns us to the world of kinetic effects in international relations; more familiar territory for IR. The resulting cooperation and coordination challenges are transboundary in nature, occur at multiple levels across sectors, between institutions, and will impact all actors, both public and private, in complex, often highly politicised ways. In this article we argue that advances in global climate governance appear to be offering an early model of a consensual rules-based approach within the existing international order that provides space for advancing agility, flexibility, and polycentrism to meet the demands of ‘wicked problems’ like the cybersecurity of the IoT. Perhaps one of the most important lessons to be drawn across from climate governance is the role of robust mechanisms for knowledge exchange – specifically between the technical and policy communities.},

We bring together contributions from leading anthropologists, technologists, political scientists, legal and communication scholars exploring how norms underpin the new ordering of the internet, whether in explicit or implicit forms. Through various theoretical lenses, contributions analyze the impact of platforms, states, civil society, expert groups and key individuals on restructuring the normative order of the internet, and present empirical evidence for instances of norm creation, legitimation, contestation and opposition. Valuable new insights for norm development processes come from case studies, ethnographies, legal and discourse analysis and interdisciplinary approaches locating agency and power plays. In this introduction, we define the key concepts applicable to norm entrepreneurship and discuss their interplay in internet governance debates, followed by an overview of the articles included in the special issue. In the final section, we reflect on the implications of our new research agenda.},

Unlike in the Internet’s ½rst generation, companies and governments are well aware of the signi½cance of design choices, and are jostling to acquire power over, and appropriate value from, networked activity. If we are to preserve the democratic and creative promise of the Internet, we must continuously diagnose control points as they emerge and devise mechanisms of recreating diversity of constraint and degrees of freedom in the network to work around these forms of reconcentrated power.},

This thread further debates on quantum (arms) race at a global level in general, and in the context of the USA and China, in particular.

However, citations made by patent examiners have not been separately reported, adding unknown noise to the data. We leverage a recent change in the reporting of patent data showing citations added by examiners. The magnitude is high: two-thirds of citations on the average patent are inserted by examiners. Furthermore, 40\% of all patents have all citations added by examiners. We analyze the distribution of examiner and inventor citations with respect to self-citation, distance, technology overlap, and vintage. Results indicate that inferences about inventor knowledge using pooled citations may suffer from bias or overinflated significance levels.

	abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to describe and explain sectoral patterns of technical change as revealed by data on about 2000 significant innovations in Britain since 1945. Most technological knowledge turns out not to be “information” that is generally applicable and easily reproducible, but specific to firms and applications, cumulative in development and varied amongst sectors in source and direction. Innovating firms principally in electronics and chemicals, are relatively big, and they develop innovations over a wide range of specific product groups within their principal sector, but relatively few outside. Firms principally in mechanical and instrument engineering are relatively small and specialised, and they exist in symbiosis with large firms, in scale intensive sectors like metal manufacture and vehicles, who make a significant contribution to their own process technology. In textile firms, on the other hand. most process innovations come from suppliers. These characteristics and variations can be classified in a three part taxonomy based on firms: (1) supplier dominated; (2) production intensive; (3) science based. They can be explained by sources of technology, requirements of users, and possibilities for appropriation. This explanation has implications for our understanding of the sources and directions of technical change, firms' diversification behaviour, the dynamic relationship between technology and industrial structure, and the formation of technological skills and advantages at the level of the firm. the region and the country.},

	abstract = {This study investigates empirically whether patents can be signals to financial markets, thus reducing problems of asymmetric information. In particular we study how patenting behaviour impacts on the way investors perceive software firms’ growth potential through an increase in the amount invested at the initial public offering (IPO) of firms in the US and Europe. This study performs regressions on the relationship of patent applications before IPO and the amount of money collected at the IPO, while controlling other factors that may influence IPO performance. We also attempt to account for a potential source of endogeneity problems that can arise for self-selection bias and simultaneity between the number of patent applications prior to going public and the amount of money collected at IPO. We find significant and robust positive correlations between patent applications and IPO performance. The signalling power of patenting is significantly different for US and European companies, and is related to the difficulty in obtaining a signal and its scarcity. An additional patent application prior to IPO increases IPO proceeds by about 0.507\% and 1.13\% for US and European companies, respectively. Results suggest that a less ‘applicant friendly’ patenting system increases the credibility of patents as signals and their value for IPO investors.},

In the US Patent citation network (USPCN), patents are classified into categories and subcategories. A natural question arises: How do patents gather their popularity from various (sub)categories? We analyse local indegree distributions to answer this question. The citation (indegree) of a patent within the same category indicates its internal popularity, while a cross-category citation indicates its external popularity. We analyze the internal and external indegree distributions at each level of USPCN hierarchy to learn how the internal and external popularity of patents varies across (sub)categories. We find that all (sub)categories have local preferences that decide internal and external patents' popularities. Different patents are popular in different groups: Groups C1, C2 and C3 may not agree on popular patents in C1. In general, patent popularity appears to be a highly local phenomenon with subcategories (not even categories) deciding their own popular patents independent of the other (sub)categories.},

	abstract = {This study proposes the usage of a method called VoteRank, created by Zhang et al. (2016), to identify influential nodes on patent citation networks. In addition, it proposes enhanced VoteRank algorithms, extending the Zhang et al. work. These novel algorithms comprise a reduction on the voting ability of the nodes affected by a chosen spreader if the nodes are distant from the spreader. One method uses a reduction factor that is linear regarding the distance from the spreader, which we called VoteRank-LRed. The other method uses a reduction factor that is exponential concerning the distance from the spreader, which we called VoteRank-XRed. By applying the methods to a citation network, we were able to demonstrate that VoteRank-LRed improved performance in choosing influence spreaders more efficiently than the original VoteRank on the tested citation network.},

	abstract = {This study aims to identify issues plaguing rural India's water supply chain and present a general methodology for the implementation of an IoT-based water distribution and management system in a rural setting. Through the literature review, significant hurdles in the water supply chain of rural India, as well as the potential role of IoT in water supply chain management, were recognized. An implementation plan was proposed to design an IoT-based water distribution and management system with the help of flow meters, ultrasonic sensors, motors, etc. Also, the feasibility of such a system was explored with the help of a use case. This study highlighted that one of the most significant reasons for water scarcity in rural India is the lack of proper infrastructure leading to water resources mismanagement. In the context of our use case, despite adequate availability of physical water for consumption, by the time water is delivered to the consumers, a significant amount of it is wasted due to the lack of an efficient water management system. It was determined that the investment return for the proposed system would break even within three months of installment. This study's results are based on inputs from governmental data collected in the Census report of 2011. As such, the ground level scenario is bound to be comparatively different today. This study is anticipated to guide governmental organizations and policymakers in the formulation of new strategies.},

The smart cities’ significant challenge is the traffic control system, wherein some places are automated and cost-effective. In this manuscript, cloud-assisted Internet of things Intelligent Transportation System (CIoT-ITS) is proposed to overcome traffic management’s challenges. Here, the IoT sensor integrated camera is installed in every traffic signal corner to monitor the vehicle’s flow. Further, the optimised vehicle flow data is sent to the cloud processes. The data from the various signal corners runs an algorithm to detect traffic direction and controls the signal lights. The alert notification is sent to the nearest traffic control room during traffic congestion using IoT sensors. Simulation analysis proved that the proposed CIoT-ITS could monitor and manage the vehicle flow successfully and automatically. The proposed system has been validated based on the optimisation parameter, which outperforms conventional methods.},

Recently, many private companies and government organizations around the world are facing the problem of cyber-attacks and the danger of wireless communication technologies. Today’s world is highly dependent on electronic technology, and protecting this data from cyber-attacks is a challenging issue. The purpose of cyber-attacks is to harm companies financially. In some other cases, cyber-attacks can have military or political purposes. Some of these damages are: PC viruses, knowledge breaks, data distribution service (DDS) and other assault vectors. To this end, various organizations use various solutions to prevent damage caused by cyber-attacks. Cyber security follows real-time information on the latest IT data. So far, various methods had been proposed by researchers around the world to prevent cyber-attacks or reduce the damage caused by them. Some of the methods are in the operational phase and others are in the study phase. The aim of this study is to survey and comprehensively review the standard advances presented in the field of cyber security and to investigate the challenges, weaknesses and strengths of the proposed methods. Different types of new descendant attacks are considered in details. Standard security frameworks are discussed with the history and early-generation cyber-security methods. In addition, emerging trends and recent developments of cyber security and security threats and challenges are presented. It is expected that the comprehensive review study presented for IT and cyber security researchers will be useful.},

In this review, we provide an introductory guide to the theory and implementation of quantum error correction codes.

	abstract = {Many real-world networks are so large that we must simplify their structure before we can extract useful information about the systems they represent. As the tools for doing these simplifications proliferate within the network literature, researchers would benefit from some guidelines about which of the so-called community detection algorithms are most appropriate for the structures they are studying and the questions they are asking. Here we show that different methods highlight different aspects of a network's structure and that the the sort of information that we seek to extract about the system must guide us in our decision. For example, many community detection algorithms, including the popular modularity maximization approach, infer module assignments from an underlying model of the network formation process. However, we are not always as interested in how a system's network structure was formed, as we are in how a network's extant structure influences the system's behavior. To see how structure influences current behavior, we will recognize that links in a network induce movement across the network and result in system-wide interdependence. In doing so, we explicitly acknowledge that most networks carry flow. To highlight and simplify the network structure with respect to this flow, we use the map equation. We present an intuitive derivation of this flow-based and information-theoretic method and provide an interactive on-line application that anyone can use to explore the mechanics of the map equation. We also describe an algorithm and provide source code to efficiently decompose large weighted and directed networks based on the map equation.},

We link these developments to changes in the data generating process for patent citations and the rise of crossciting amongst large patent families.

Index of real-world network graphs based on some of the commonly used centrality metrics (betweenness, eigenvector and closeness) in addition to degree centrality and observe that the assortativity classification of real-world network graphs depends on the node-level centrality metric used. We also propose five different levels of assortativity (strongly assortative, weakly assortative, neutral, weakly dissortative and strongly dissortative) for real-world networks and the corresponding range of A. Index value for the classification. We analyze a collection of 50 real-world network graphs with respect to each of the above four centrality metrics and estimate the empirical probability of observing a real-world network graph to exhibit a particular level of assortativity. We claim that a real-world network graph is more likely to be neutral with respect to the betweenness and degree centrality metrics and more likely to be assortative with respect to the eigenvector and closeness centrality metrics.},

We relate eigenvector centralization to assortativity and core – periphery and use simple simulations to demonstrate how eigenvector centralization is ideal for revealing the conditions under which network structure produces suboptimal utilization of available information.

              As indispensable as the internet has become in our daily lives, it still has many shortcomings, not least of which is that communication can be intercepted and information stolen. If, however, the internet attained the capability of transmitting quantum information—qubits—many of these security concerns would be addressed. Wehner

              BACKGROUND
              The internet has had a revolutionary impact on our world. The vision of a quantum internet is to provide fundamentally new internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. Such a quantum internet will—in synergy with the “classical” internet that we have today—connect quantum information processors in order to achieve unparalleled capabilities that are provably impossible by using only classical information.
              As with any radically new technology, it is hard to predict all uses of the future quantum internet. However, several major applications have already been identified, including secure communication, clock synchronization, extending the baseline of telescopes, secure identification, achieving efficient agreement on distributed data, exponential savings in communication, quantum sensor networks, as well as secure access to remote quantum computers in the cloud.
              Central to all these applications is the ability of a quantum internet to transmit quantum bits (qubits) that are fundamentally different than classical bits. Whereas classical bits can take only two values, 0 or 1, qubits can be in a superposition of being 0 and 1 at the same time. Moreover, qubits can be entangled with each other, leading to correlations over large distances that are much stronger than is possible with classical information. Qubits also cannot be copied, and any attempt to do so can be detected. This feature makes qubits well suited for security applications but at the same time makes the transmission of qubits require radically new concepts and technology. Rapid experimental progress in recent years has brought first rudimentary quantum networks within reach, highlighting the timeliness and need for a unified framework for quantum internet researchers.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              We define different stages of development toward a full-blown quantum internet. We expect that this classification will be instrumental in guiding and assessing experimental progress as well as stimulating the development of new applications by providing a common language and reference frame for the different scientific and engineering disciplines involved.
              More advanced stages are distinguished by a larger amount of functionality, thus supporting ever more sophisticated application protocols. For each stage, we describe some of the application protocols that are already known and that can be realized with the functionality provided in that stage. It is conceivable that a simpler protocol, or better theoretical analysis, may be found in the future that solves the same task but is less demanding in terms of functionality. In parallel to the daunting experimental challenges in making quantum internet a reality, there is thus an opportunity for quantum software developers to design protocols that can realize a task in a stage that can be implemented more easily. We identify relevant parameters for each stage to establish a common language between hardware and software developers. Last, we review technological progress in experimental physics, engineering, and computer science that is required to attain such stages.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              Building and scaling quantum networks is a formidable endeavor, requiring sustained and concerted efforts in physics, computer science, and engineering to succeed. The proposed stages of development will facilitate interdisciplinary communication by summarizing what we may actually want to achieve and providing guidelines both to protocol design and software development as well as hardware implementations through experimental physics and engineering. Although it is hard to predict what the exact components of a future quantum internet will be, it is likely that we will see the birth of the first multinode quantum networks in the next few years. This development brings the exciting opportunity to test all the ideas and functionalities that so far only exist on paper and may indeed be the dawn of a future large-scale quantum internet.
              
                
                  Stages in the development of a quantum internet.
                  Each stage is characterized by an increase in functionality at the expense of greater technological difficulty. This Review provides a clear definition of each stage, including benchmarks and examples of known applications, and provides an overview of the technological progress required to attain these stages.

            The internet—a vast network that enables simultaneous long-range classical communication—has had a revolutionary impact on our world. The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. Such a quantum internet may operate in parallel to the internet that we have today and connect quantum processors in order to achieve capabilities that are provably impossible by using only classical means. Here, we propose stages of development toward a full-blown quantum internet and highlight experimental and theoretical progress needed to attain them.},

As a result of the review, it was found that, elapsed years since filing, the number of patent claims, the number of claim letters, the number of inventors, the number of patent family countries, and the number of patent families, as well as IPC diversity, had a positive and significant effect on the number of citations. The results of this study are expected to provide a basic basis for considering the IPC diversity index together in analyzing and evaluating future patents and establishing strategies for creating excellent patents.},

	abstract = {We argue that gender inequality in science and technology means that ideas are less likely to be built upon if their author is a woman versus a man. Testing this empirically is challenging because men and women tend to work on different ideas whose potential is largely unobservable. To address this challenge, we exploit the occurrence of simultaneous discoveries in science – i.e., instances when a man and a woman have published the same idea around the same time – and track the citations to their subsequent publications in patented inventions. We find that scientific publications receive fewer patent citations, that is, they have a lower technological impact, when their main author is a woman. This gap is not driven by women’s lower propensity to produce patented inventions based on their own ideas, but rather by other inventors’ lower likelihood to build on those ideas. Additional analysis suggests that supply-side factors alone, such as the greater saliency of men’s work, are unlikely to drive our results. Rather, inventors seem to pay more attention to men’s ideas. Our research highlights that gender inequality shapes more than individuals’ careers. It also shapes the extent to which their ideas are used to create new technologies.},

	abstract = {What motivates Chinese media campaigns during foreign policy disputes, and how are they carried out? “Influence campaigns” are often recognized as highly pertinent to international security, yet they remain understudied. This article develops and tests a theory that explains these media campaigns as strategic actions to align domestic public opinion when it deviates from the state’s preferred foreign policy, exploiting the media’s mobilization or pacification effect. These divergent media effects correspond to two types of media campaigns, respectively—mobilization campaigns and pacification campaigns. The pacification campaigns are particularly important because they indicate that hawkish rhetoric may counterintuitively pacify the public, and hence its adoption implies a moderate foreign policy intent. A medium-N congruence test of 21 Chinese diplomatic crises and process tracing of the 2016 Sino-Philippines arbitration case offer strong support for the theory and demonstrate how a pacification campaign works and how it differs from a mobilization campaign.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the problem of drone violence that is ‘grey’ in the sense of being hard to categorise. It focuses on circumstances, such as arose in Pakistan, in which a foreign government's armed drones are a constant presence. A lesson from US experience there is that the persistent threat of drone strikes is intended to suppress activities that endanger the drone-using state's security. However, this threat inevitably affects innocent people living within potential strike zones. To judge such drone use by reference to military ethics principles is to assume that ‘war’ is going on, but indefinite drone deployments are difficult to conceptualise as war, so traditional Just War thinking does not suffice as a basis for moral judgement. In assessing the US government's commitment to drone-based containment of risks emerging along its ‘terror frontier’, the article considers three alternative conceptualisations of drone violence arising in non-war contexts: vim (‘force short of war’), terrorism, and imperialism. It then rejects all three and proposes that such violence is better conceptualised as being merely ‘quasi-imperialistic’. On this basis, however, the sustaining of a drone strike campaign against a series of suspected terrorists can still be condemned as violating the right to life.},

	abstract = {There is considerable and growing interest in the emergence of novel technologies, especially from the policy-making perspective. Yet, as an area of study, emerging technologies lack key foundational elements, namely a consensus on what classifies a technology as ‘emergent’ and strong research designs that operationalise central theoretical concepts. The present paper aims to fill this gap by developing a definition of ‘emerging technologies’ and linking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the operationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by combining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of ‘emergence’ with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional issues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five attributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i) radical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent impact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising emerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed attributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly in, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and study of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis, citation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof) and elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different attributes of emergence.},

	url = {https://www.csis.org/analysis/made-china-2025},
	abstract = {Q1: What is "Made in China 2025"? A1:  "Made in China 2025" is an initiative to comprehensively upgrade Chinese industry. The initiative draws direct inspiration from Germany's "Industry 4.0"  plan, which was first discussed in 2011 and later adopted in 2013. The heart of the "Industry 4.0" idea is intelligent manufacturing, i.e., applying the  tools of information technology to production. In the German context, this primarily means using the Internet of Things to connect small and medium-sized  companies more efficiently in global production and innovation networks so that they could not only more efficiently engage in mass production but just as  easily and efficiently customize products. The Chinese effort is far broader, as the efficiency and quality of Chinese producers are highly uneven, and multiple challenges need to be overcome in a  short amount of time if China is to avoid being squeezed by both newly emerging low-cost producers and more effectively cooperate and compete with advanced  industrialized economies. The English translation of "中国制造2025" -- "Made in China 2025" -- does capture the goal of localization, but it misses the focus  on the manufacturing qua manufacturing. The plan was drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) over two and a half years, with  input from 150 experts from the China Academy of Engineering. Q2: What are its key contents? A2:  Based on the State Council document summarizing the plan released last week, "Made in China 2025" has clear principles, goals, tools, and sector focus.  Its guiding principles are to have manufacturing be innovation-driven, emphasize quality over quantity, achieve green development, optimize the structure  of Chinese industry, and nurture human talent.  The goal is to comprehensively upgrade Chinese industry, making it more efficient and integrated so that it can occupy the highest parts of global  production chains. The plan identifies the goal of raising domestic content of core components and materials to 40\% by 2020 and 70\% by 2025.  Although there is a significant role for the state in providing an overall framework, utilizing financial and fiscal tools, and supporting the creation  of manufacturing innovation centers (15 by 2020 and 40 by 2025), the plan also calls for relying on market institutions, strengthening intellectual  property rights protection for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the more effective use of intellectual property (IP) in business strategy, and  allowing firms to self-declare their own technology standards and help them better participate in international standards setting.  Although the goal is to upgrade industry writ large, the plan highlights 10 priority sectors: 1) New advanced information technology; 2) Automated  machine tools \& robotics; 3) Aerospace and aeronautical equipment; 4) Maritime equipment and high-tech shipping; 5) Modern rail transport equipment; 6)  New-energy vehicles and equipment; 7) Power equipment; 8) Agricultural equipment; 9) New materials; and 10) Biopharma and advanced medical products. Q3: Is "Made in China 2025" an extension of the 2010 plan to support "Strategic Emerging Industries"? A3:  The unveiling of "Made in China 2025" suggests a major departure from the Hu-Wen administration's approach to innovation and technology upgrading. The  heart of their approach was the Medium- and Long-Term Plan on the Development of Science \& Technology. A 15-year plan issued in 2006, the plan's key  concept was "indigenous innovation" (自主创新) and focused entirely on advanced technologies. The culmination of the plan was the identification in October  2010 of seven "strategic emerging industries" (战略性新兴产业) that were seen as vital for China to achieve mastery in if it was to become an advanced economy.  The core of the plan focused on developed leading-edge advanced technologies through investment in R\&D from state and industry sources, accumulation of  intellectual property, setting of distinct technical standards, and leveraging access to the Chinese market in exchange for foreign technologies. The plan  set a target of SEI-related industries to account for 8\% of the economy by 2015 and 15\% by 2020. The plan was developed jointly by National Development and  Reform Commission (NDRC) and Ministry of Science \& Technology (MOST), with supplemental input from MIIT and other ministries. "Made in China 2025" is different in multiple respects: 1) It focuses on the entire manufacturing process and not just innovation; 2) It promotes the  development of not only advanced industries, but traditional industries and modern services; 3) There is still a focus on state involvement, but market  mechanisms are more prominent than in SEI. For example, instead of focusing on top-down, unique domestic technical standards, the attention is on  self-declared standards and the international standards system; and 4) There are clear and specific measures for innovation, quality, intelligent  manufacturing, and green production, with benchmarks identified for 2013 and 2015 and goals set for 2020 and 2025. In this regard, the proposal reads much  more like a five-year plan (which I believe is intentional), even though laid out over 10 years. The plan's language is also very different than under Hu-Wen. The term "indigenous innovation" appears only twice and "SEI" only once. There is no obvious  effort to paint this as the successor to or extension of SEI, but in fact, to show that an SEI-oriented focus was too narrow and built on a  misunderstanding of China's core needs and comparative advantage. In addition, the original focus on innovation took inspiration from similar innovation  programs developed in the United States, Japan, and the EU during the 2000's in the wake of the information technology revolution and a common concern  about technological competitiveness. As mentioned above, "Made in China 2025" is more consistent with how Germany and Japan approach their economies than  the United States. Although there will no doubt be problems with implementation and perhaps create new market-access challenges for multi-national companies (MNCs), from a  Chinese national-interest perspective, this plan is much better conceived and more appropriate for China's situation than the "indigenous innovation"  approach and SEIs. It will be more coordinated and utilize a wider array of policy tools. If a "Made in China 2025" leading group has not already been  created, I expect there to be one soon. Q4: What are the implications for MNCs? A4:  MNCs face new challenges and opportunities with this plan. In terms of challenges, a clear goal is to make Chinese companies more competitive across the  board, to localize production of components and final products, and to have Chinese firms move up the value-added chain in production and innovation  networks, and to achieve much greater international brand recognition. In addition, the plan calls for Chinese firms to ramp up their efforts to invest  abroad, and to do so by becoming more familiar with overseas cultures and markets, and to strengthen investment and operation risk management. (The  drafters are clearly sensitive to the high proportion of failed overseas investments.) It specifies focus on the countries that together make up the Silk  Road initiative, but it is meant to apply everywhere. Government measures and market incentives will be used to pursue these goals. In some ways, this  represents a frontal challenge to advanced manufacturing in the US, Europe, and East Asia. At the same time, MNCs and other countries can benefit in three ways. First, there will be greater investment and attention to the ten industries, and MNCs  that align themselves with these sectors and the general goals of this plan can benefit from its focus. In some ways, there will be greater competition  from Chinese companies and a buy-local push, but it's a guarantee that MNCs will be needed to provide critical components, technology, and management for  this plan is to work. Second, to the extent China genuinely embraces intelligent manufacturing, it will be much easier for Chinese companies and MNCs to  collaborate, both in China and elsewhere. This is a big 'if', but it is potentially a way to reduce the zero-sum elements of the business relationship. And  third, most broadly, if China successfully upgrades its manufacturing capacity, that will have meant it has also likely improved its overall economic  governance, including its financial and fiscal systems, strengthened the education system, and increased access to varied sources of information. These  should all be of general benefit to the global economy and MNCs. Q5: How is Premier Li Keqiang's recent tour of Latin America related to this plan? A5:  Strengthening relations with Latin America has been a priority for China's leadership. In early 2014 Beijing announced the creation of the China-Community  of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) Forum, which met for the first time this January. Xi Jinping has made two trips to the region, and Li  Keqiang just completed a 9-day tour of Brazil, Columbia, Peru, and Chile. Li signed dozens of agreements promoting economic cooperation, worth over \$100  billion. Although Premier Li didn't specifically tout "Made in China 2025," he emphasized that China's renewed focus on advanced manufacturing would be  beneficial to Latin America's economy, moving the commercial relationship's focus away from natural resources toward basic infrastructure, industry, and  information technology. Li stressed that expanded Chinese investment in everything from high-speed rail to telecom should also help Latin America upgrade  its manufacturing capacity and industrial structure as well. We can expect that the Chinese leadership will continue to carry a similar message wherever  their travels take them.

	abstract = {Global influence can be exercised in a number of ways. For the EU, that has traditionally included a strong
commitment to multilateral institutions and standardisation bodies, and the willingness to use them to
promote its system of values, but also to defend its own interests. This is in addition to the so-called
"Brussels effect" which is an indirect way in which the EU, through the size of its market, has become a
global standards setter.
But China is increasingly seeing the value of these institutions and bodies as a way of pursuing its own
interests. This paper describes how this is happening. It does so by looking at how influence on decisionmaking in the United Nations and its agencies is exercised, whether in terms of budget, coalition building
or leadership positions, and at the level of political investment in international standardisation
organisations.
The long-term impact of this trend is not only about who manages to be most effective at using
multilateral institutions for their own interests, but also how the nature of these institutions could change
over time.
The paper includes a look at the possible impact on the issue of the attitude and policy of the new Biden
administration.},

This paper empirically analyses the relation between public-private career crossovers of high-ranking government officials and financial policy. Using information based on curriculum vitae of more than 400 central bank governors and finance ministers from 32 OECD countries between 1973-2005, a new dataset was compiled including details on officials’ professional careers before as well as after their tenure and data on financial regulation. Time-series cross-sectional analyses show that central bank governors with past experience in the financial sector deregulate significantly more than governors without a background in finance (career socialisation hypothesis). Using linear probability regressions, the results also indicate that finance ministers, especially from left-wing parties, are more likely to be hired by financial entities in the future if they please their future employers through deregulatory policies during their time in office (career concerns hypothesis). Thus, although the revolving door effects differ between government officials, this study shows that career paths and career concerns of policy-makers matter. This has wider implications both for academic research on and legislative measures against the revolving door.},

It was found that upon rotation from the {\textbar}0〉 state to the {\textbar}1〉 state, the charge density in the intermediate state changes asymmetrically relative to the bonds of the P atom with the neighbouring Si atoms., The dependent behaviour of a pair of phosphorus atoms in silicene was shown by a DFT calculation with constrained magnetization.

High-fidelity (more than 99.9 per cent) coherent control of such qubits has been demonstrated3, promising an attractive platform for quantum computing. However, inter-qubit coupling—which is essential for realizing large-scale circuits in atom-based qubits—has not yet been achieved. Exchange interactions between electron spins4,5 promise fast (gigahertz) gate operations with two-qubit gates, as recently demonstrated in gate-defined silicon quantum dots6–10. However, creating a tunable exchange interaction between two electrons bound to phosphorus atom qubits has not been possible until now. This is because it is difficult to determine the atomic distance required to turn the exchange interaction on and off while aligning the atomic circuitry for high-fidelity, independent spin readout.

	abstract = {Future quantum internet applications will derive their power from the ability to share quantum information across the network1,2. Quantum teleportation allows for the reliable transfer of quantum information between distant nodes, even in the presence of highly lossy network connections3. Although many experimental demonstrations have been performed on different quantum network platforms4–10, moving beyond directly connected nodes has, so far, been hindered by the demanding requirements on the pre-shared remote entanglement, joint qubit readout and coherence times. Here we realize quantum teleportation between remote, non-neighbouring nodes in a quantum network. The network uses three optically connected nodes based on solid-state spin qubits. The teleporter is prepared by establishing remote entanglement on the two links, followed by entanglement swapping on the middle node and storage in a memory qubit. We demonstrate that, once successful preparation of the teleporter is heralded, arbitrary qubit states can be teleported with fidelity above the classical bound, even with unit efficiency. These results are enabled by key innovations in the qubit readout procedure, active memory qubit protection during entanglement generation and tailored heralding that reduces remote entanglement infidelities. Our work demonstrates a prime building block for future quantum networks and opens the door to exploring teleportation-based multi-node protocols and applications2,11–13.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this lecture note is to introduce lattice based cryptography, which is thought to be a cryptosystem of post-quantum age. We have tried to give as many details possible specially for novice on the subject. Something may be trivial to an expert but not to a novice. Many fundamental problems about lattice are thought to be hard even against quantum computer, compared to factorization problem which can be solved easily with quantum computer, via the celebrated Shor factorization quantum algorithm. The first part of our presentation is based on slides of Christ Peikert 2013 Bonn lecture (crypt@b-it2013). We, more or less, give somewhat detailed explanation of Professor Peikert's lecture slides. We unfortunately could not attend his Bonn class. We are afraid that there are many mistakes in this note; if any, they are due to our misunderstanding of the material. Part II of our lecture note is on ring LWE, based on the paper ``A tool-kit for Ring-LWE Cryptography" by Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev. Part III is about multilinear maps together with cryptanalysis of GGH map due to Hu and Jia. Our presentation follows professor Steinfeld's lecture slides on GGHLite, and the paper by Yupu Hu and Huiwen Jia. When you read this lecture note, the corresponding original paper should be accompanied. We thank professor Jung Hee Cheon for introducing the subject and asking Dong Pyo Chi to give a lecture on the subject at the department of mathematics in Seoul National University. We also thank Hyeongkwan Kim for many helps, especially many corrections and improvements of the manuscript during the 2015 Summer session at UNIST. We also thank the students who took the classes at SNU and UNIST. The lecture was given by a novice for novice, so many mistakes are unavoidable. If the reader lets us know any errors, we will very much appreciate it.},

	abstract = {One of the biggest challenges in experimental quantum information is to sustain the fragile superposition state of a qubit1. Long lifetimes can be achieved for material qubit carriers as memories2, at least in principle, but not for propagating photons that are rapidly lost by absorption, diffraction or scattering3. The loss problem can be mitigated with a nondestructive photonic qubit detector that heralds the photon without destroying the encoded qubit. Such a detector is envisioned to facilitate protocols in which distributed tasks depend on the successful dissemination of photonic qubits4,5, improve loss-sensitive qubit measurements6,7 and enable certain quantum key distribution attacks8. Here we demonstrate such a detector based on a single atom in two crossed fibre-based optical resonators, one for qubit-insensitive atom–photon coupling and the other for atomic-state detection9. We achieve a nondestructive detection efficiency upon qubit survival of 79 ± 3 per cent and a photon survival probability of 31 ± 1 per cent, and we preserve the qubit information with a fidelity of 96.2 ± 0.3 per cent. To illustrate the potential of our detector, we show that it can, with the current parameters, improve the rate and fidelity of long-distance entanglement and quantum state distribution compared to previous methods, provide resource optimization via qubit amplification and enable detection-loophole-free Bell tests.},

	abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses individual light quanta in quantum superposition states to guarantee unconditional communication security between distant parties. However, the distance over which QKD is achievable has been limited to a few hundred kilometres, owing to the channel loss that occurs when using optical fibres or terrestrial free space that exponentially reduces the photon transmission rate. Satellite-based QKD has the potential to help to establish a global-scale quantum network, owing to the negligible photon loss and decoherence experienced in empty space. Here we report the development and launch of a low-Earth-orbit satellite for implementing decoy-state QKD—a form of QKD that uses weak coherent pulses at high channel loss and is secure because photon-number-splitting eavesdropping can be detected. We achieve a kilohertz key rate from the satellite to the ground over a distance of up to 1,200 kilometres. This key rate is around 20 orders of magnitudes greater than that expected using an optical fibre of the same length. The establishment of a reliable and efficient space-to-ground link for quantum-state transmission paves the way to global-scale quantum networks.},

	shorttitle = {China's {Change}},
	abstract = {'Importantly, China's Change: The Greatest Show on Earth provides a welcome contrast to such fashionable pessimism … demolishes a series of popular urban myths … and a very convincing case he makes. This, to my mind, is a wholly original approach to understanding present-day China and the book is well worth reading for this alone. … readers are likely to end up considerably wiser about how the Chinese economy has developed and how it currently works. It's difficult to do justice to the exceptionally wide-ranging scope of the book. It is, furthermore, well-written (as befits a former journalist) and highly readable. … a useful corrective for the innate pessimism which has pervaded so much Western economic and financial commentary in recent years.'The Society of Professional Economists (SPE)China's Change injects timely, original ideas into the world's most important, if confused, debate over how to manage the twin challenges of anaemic economic growth and accelerating global disruption. Change is the cry from the US to Europe, Asia to Australasia. The snag is the West has no playbook to help. China however, to regain control of its future, has regularly reinvented itself by understanding change's nature through traditional philosophy.This is not idle conjecture. It is what China has done time and again, including most recently with COVID-19 where it identified clear goals, priorities and means to bring the coronavirus under control.This book argues it is time to 'Look at China' but stresses China's approach to managing change only supplies the process not individual policies: the how not the what. Policies have to be created locally. In managing change, traditional thought is China's X-Factor, the key to China's record-breaking economic transformation. To grasp this, China's Change provides an understanding of China's past, present and future through its philosophy, history, economics, business, politics, prospects and impact in a way that no other book has done.Two big global questions are answered. Can other countries, firms and individuals find paths out of their dim twilight by adapting China's change process? Can China continue to create one-third of world growth, more than the US, EU and Japan combined, to help cure the last decade's global economic malaise?China's roadmap for change enables anyone to navigate growing global disruption. Ironically China's process is built on such ignored-in-the-West ideas as long-term thinking, clear priorities, gradualism and non-ideological pragmatism that earlier powered two centuries of Western economic dominance. If the West and rest of Asia learn from China to manage change, the next global surprise could be another turning of the tables. There is no end to history, only more turns of the wheel: for now China's Change is again the Greatest Show on Earth.Related Link(s)},

Using a grounded theory approach, the authors thematically analyzed both sets of letters to ascertain common topics, stylistic (writing) features, and embedded cultural attributes. They found that although both sets of letters share much regulatory and financial information, the Latin American letters are characterized by a richer mix of topics, a more complex writing style, and evidence of cultural dimensions as conceptualized by the research of scholars such as Geert Hofstede and Edward T. Hall. Their work is founded on the belief that corporate documents exist to communicate more than factual information to their constituencies. Rather, the purpose of corporate writers is to influence public opinion and attitudes, particularly among potential investors, in ways that create support for organizational practices or undermine opposition to them.},

As the demand grows, additional providers are expected to enter the market. The need for 24/7 support and competitive pricing allows established providers to maintain defensible industry positions. This paper examines the impact of adopting growth and equilibrium market share strategies by cloud providers. Capacity planning remains a challenging problem given uncertain growth and demand, and providers seeking to pursue different market share strategies must adopt different tactics. Results from a system dynamics simulation indicate that market share growth can be achieved at the cost of overall revenue. A reactive strategy to maintain market share requires more price manipulation, but results in higher overall income. Simulations are conducted for a variety of economic conditions, with a view to providing cloud service providers broad guidance for cloud capacity building strategies.},

	url = {https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-can-patent-data-reveal-about-us-china-technology-competition},
	abstract = {This Critical Questions draws on an August 30 CSIS panel discussion “U.S. Technological Leadership and Patents: What Can the Data Tell Us?” A recording of the webinar, moderated by CSIS senior advisors Andrei Iancu and Kirti Gupta can be viewed here. The United States and China are engaged in a strategic competition for global technological leadership. In seeking ways to gauge this competition, business leaders, policymakers, the media, and even the courts often turn to data on patent filings. Prudent use of this data requires a closer look at what the data can and cannot say. While patent data is widely used as a metric of national competitiveness and innovation, it is important to be mindful that patents vary greatly in quality. The volume of patent applications can also be manipulated through government or firm incentives. And, of course, patents are only one measure of a country’s innovative capacity. Understanding these limitations is important because where this data comes from and how this data is used affects perceptions of the current landscape of competition, and in turn, policies affecting support for critical technologies ranging from 5G communications and artificial intelligence to quantum information science and advanced semiconductors. Q1: What does cross-national data reveal about patent applications? A1: The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) IP Statistics Data Center compiles decades of historical data on patent applications and grants at both the international and national levels. This information, which incorporates data on foreign patent filings, shows that patent applications filed and grants awarded by China’s National Intellectual Property Administration have been on a steady increase since 2000, with significant year-over-year increases beginning in the early 2010s. Comparisons based on raw, aggregated patent data show that China has been the world’s leader in patent applications and grants for nearly a decade. When measuring numbers of patents granted for technologies of strategic significance, including semiconductors, computer technology, telecommunications, energy technology, and biotech, China appears to be the global leader or a peer of the United States.     Q2: What does the data purport to show? A2: By looking at relative global trends in patent filings, researchers and policymakers can gain some insight into where individual countries are focusing their efforts technologically and the speed with which they are transitioning toward a knowledge-based economy. Security analysts also examine changes in patent trajectories because cutting-edge technologies are often developed first for military usage. Large patent application numbers can also be loosely indicative of how attractive a country’s intellectual property laws are, as inventors are incentivized to file where the protection of their ideas is best safeguarded. WIPO data show that Chinese filers dominate patent applications for inventions, utility models, or designs. In 2019, WIPO reported that China filed 1.4 million patents, or 43.4 percent of the world’s total patent applications that year. This was more than twice the level of applications in the United States. China’s increase in patent applications appears to echo its rapid industrialization. As China seeks to lead in a series of emerging technologies, many experts use patenting data to demonstrate the speed and trajectory of China’s technological progress. Q3: What are the drawbacks of using patent data as a measure of competitiveness? A3: Major news outlets routinely cite numbers of patent filings as a measure of competitiveness and these numbers should be read with caution. First, patenting data by itself does not provide a full picture of the health of a nation’s innovation system. Innovation is the result of a network of collaborative actions of which patent filings and citations only capture one observable, if somewhat noisy “output.” Research and development (R\&D) intensity, which measures R\&D expenditures as a percentage of per capita GDP, is another static marker that shows relative national efforts to sustain innovation. Notably, the World Bank’s June 2022 data on this show the United States, Japan, South Korea, and most Western European nations greatly outperforming China in this regard. Other factors used for predicting a nation’s innovation potential include educational achievement, number of working-age adults, firm valuations, and royalty payments, which recoups the cost of R\&D and reveals the value that the market has put on that innovation. Second, relying on aggregate patent data can be misleading because some governments and firms manipulate data by creating incentives and targets to boost patent applications. Some researchers have pointed out that Chinese officials incentivize domestic patent filings, and that the resulting data is enhanced to meet policy or political targets. As evidence, they point to unusual trends of filings peaking at the end of a calendar year, which suggests that a quota is being achieved by firms breaking up their inventions to come up with more applications. Third, simply counting patent applications can mix low-value and high-value patents—both those that support incremental innovations and those that support disruptive change. Acknowledging this point, a Chinese official in 2019 stated that only 10 percent of China’s patents have market value and that probably 90 percent of them are “trash.” This reality does not entirely discount measuring patents granted as a mark of national innovativeness, or even the state of the U.S.-China technological competition, but it does mean that doing so should necessarily handle conclusions based on raw patent data with caution. Fourth, although patent data are one measure of innovation, in the sense that many companies disclose their inventions to safeguard their intellectual property, it is also worth bearing in mind that companies, in some cases, choose to keep these inventions secret. The bottom line is that patent data should be used with care as a measure of national innovative capacity and competitiveness. Simply tallying the number of patented inventions and using this to declare a leader in whichever technology is applied can be misleading.

In this article, a new perspective based on the patent citation network is provided to explore the dynamic evolution and mode of OI. In our framework of the OI network, enterprises are represented as nodes, and patent citations represent cross-organizational knowledge flow, which are ties in the network. The Driver Assistance System (DAS) was selected as the research case. Time-sliced patent citation networks are constructed, and then an exponential random graph model is employed to identify the formation mechanism of OI networks. The results show that the OI network of DAS is still partially open and at a low level. The inherent dominance of automakers may have been weakened, and new models and relationships in innovation activities are developing. In addition, heterogeneity in type and geographic proximity which significantly promote the formation of the open network was prevented, but the larger scale of the enterprise inhibited the OI network. R\&D investment has no obvious impact. This research provides a new perspective to observe open innovation and helps stakeholders to better understand industry trends.},

We argue that this narrative misreads both the substance and dynamics of recent Chinese policy. Since 2016, China has strenuously sought ? and largely managed ? not to be in technical violation of the Philippines Arbitration Tribunal ruling despite having publicly disavowed it and has attempted to position itself as a champion of win?win co-operation. This stands in stark contrast to the previous four years in which China rather shockingly began asserting itself with little regard for either legality or diplomatic nicety ? the period in which the ?aggressive China? narrative gelled. What explains China's whiplash behaviour? Why has the international community largely failed to notice recent changes and adjust the narrative accordingly? We argue that the answers to these questions lie in an eclectic appeal to bureaucratic struggles, the regime's two-level game balancing domestic and international pressures, and psychological considerations. These do not, however, provide satisfactory accounts either of China's behaviour or of the international response in the absence of recognising the crucial importance of second-order rules for making, interpreting, and applying first-order rules in the international system. Social practices of rule-making, in short, provide vital context. Our analysis suggests a series of takeaways both for International Relations theory and for managing relations with China.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the questions of corporate power represented by digital platforms. We undertake a conceptual analysis of platform power so that it can provide an explanation of key motivations and behaviours for monopolisation in the platform economy. We argue that there emerges a hierarchical power structure in which platform companies relentlessly pursue power over users, and small platforms increasingly depend on big tech and financial capital. Drawing theoretical insights from the monopoly capital school and empirical evidence from platform companies in China, this paper further explores the macroeconomic implications of platform monopolisation and financialisation. It is demonstrated that the hierarchical power structure in the platform economy may increase income inequality, exacerbate overcapacity and generate financial instability.},

Increasingly, applications for the IoT involve analytics. Data analytics is the process of deriving knowledge from data, generating value like actionable insights from them. This article reviews work in the IoT and big data analytics from the perspective of their utility in creating efficient, effective, and innovative applications and services for a wide spectrum of domains. We review the broad vision for the IoT as it is shaped in various communities, examine the application of data analytics across IoT domains, provide a categorisation of analytic approaches, and propose a layered taxonomy from IoT data to analytics. This taxonomy provides us with insights on the appropriateness of analytical techniques, which in turn shapes a survey of enabling technology and infrastructure for IoT analytics. Finally, we look at some tradeoffs for analytics in the IoT that can shape future research.},

Quantum technologies for military applications introduce new capabilities, improving effectiveness and increasing precision, thus leading to ‘quantum warfare’, wherein new military strategies, doctrines, policies and ethics should be established. This report provides a basic overview of quantum technologies under development, also estimating the expected time scale of delivery or the utilisation impact. Particular military applications of quantum technology are described for various warfare domains (e.g. land, air, space, electronic, cyber and underwater warfare and ISTAR—intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance), and related issues and challenges are articulated.},

We also aim that the review is accessible to non-experts in the field. Hence several appendixes and a technical glossary are included.},

It is natural, therefore, to explore their application to radar, despite the fact that decoherence-caused by the loss and noise encountered in radar sensing-destroys these fragile quantum properties. This article tells the story of “quantum illumination,” an entanglement-based approach to quantum radar, from its inception to its current understanding. Remarkably, despite loss and noise that destroy its initial entanglement, quantum illumination does offer a target-detection performance improvement over a classical radar of the same transmitted energy. A realistic assessment of that improvement's utility, however, shows that its value is severely limited. Nevertheless, the fact that entanglement can be of value on an entanglement-breaking channel-the meta-lesson of the quantum illumination story-should spur continued research on quantum radar.},

	abstract = {We have developed a novel family of low-noise superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to cover a wide range of applications. These sensors are robust and easy to use without compromising noise performance. They are optimized for operation with our high-speed direct-coupled flux-locked loop (FLL) electronics XXF-1. For the readout of cryogenic detectors, series arrays of 16 SQUIDs with 3 nH input inductance were designed which can be cooled down and operated in the Earth's field without magnetic shield. A compact gradiometric design allows the chips to be mounted directly on a Cu block at the cold stage of a mK cryostat without degradation in noise. A current noise level of 9 or 5 is achieved at 4.2 K or 300 mK, respectively. Ultra-high-speed operation was demonstrated by using a cold FLL electronics prototype in close proximity to the SQUID array. An extremely high FLL bandwidth of 350 MHz was achieved which outperforms any flux-locked SQUID before by more than an order of magnitude. For applications requiring a larger input inductance of up to 2 , integrated two-stage sensors were developed consisting of a single front-end SQUID with double-transformer coupling read out by a 16-SQUID array. These sensors are very convenient to use as their voltage-flux characteristic is essentially single-SQUID-like. Devices optimized for 4.2 K operation have a coupled energy resolution around 50 times Planck's constant . Heavily shunted devices for low-temperature operation typically achieve 80 or 8 at 4.2 K or 300 mK, respectively. An optional current limiter (Q-spoiler) at the input reduces the input current in pulsed applications like nuclear magnetic resonance or magnetorelaxometry. Integrated rf filters and resistor-capacitor shunts across the input coil result in smooth, well-behaved voltage-flux characteristics even at low temperatures 4.2 K. For magnetic field sensing applications, integrated miniature multiloop magnetometers were designed with maximized field resolution. For a 3 mm 3 mm chip size, a noise level of 3.6 is obtained at 4.2 K.},

	abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD)1,2 has the potential to enable secure communication and information transfer3. In the laboratory, the feasibility of point-to-point QKD is evident from the early proof-of-concept demonstration in the laboratory over 32 centimetres4; this distance was later extended to the 100-kilometre scale5,6 with decoy-state QKD and more recently to the 500-kilometre scale7–10 with measurement-device-independent QKD. Several small-scale QKD networks have also been tested outside the laboratory11–14. However, a global QKD network requires a practically (not just theoretically) secure and reliable QKD network that can be used by a large number of users distributed over a wide area15. Quantum repeaters16,17 could in principle provide a viable option for such a global network, but they cannot be deployed using current technology18. Here we demonstrate an integrated space-to-ground quantum communication network that combines a large-scale fibre network of more than 700 fibre QKD links and two high-speed satellite-to-ground free-space QKD links. Using a trusted relay structure, the fibre network on the ground covers more than 2,000 kilometres, provides practical security against the imperfections of realistic devices, and maintains long-term reliability and stability. The satellite-to-ground QKD achieves an average secret-key rate of 47.8 kilobits per second for a typical satellite pass—more than 40 times higher than achieved previously. Moreover, its channel loss is comparable to that between a geostationary satellite and the ground, making the construction of more versatile and ultralong quantum links via geosynchronous satellites feasible. Finally, by integrating the fibre and free-space QKD links, the QKD network is extended to a remote node more than 2,600 kilometres away, enabling any user in the network to communicate with any other, up to a total distance of 4,600 kilometres.},

Perhaps the most crucial of these is the realization of a quantum repeater, an essential component in the long-distance transmission of quantum information. As the analog of a classical repeater, extender, or booster, the quantum repeater works to overcome loss and noise in the quantum channels comprising a quantum network. Here, we review the conceptual frameworks and architectures for quantum repeaters, as well as the experimental progress towards their realization. We also discuss the various near-term proposals to overcome the limits to the communication rates set by point-to-point quantum communication.

States can design arms control institutions to curtail costly competition over some military technology. But they also do not want to limit valuable civilian uses. How does the dual use nature of technology shape the prospects for cooperation? We argue that the duality of technology presents a challenge not by its very existence but rather through the ways it alters information constraints on the design of arms control institutions. We characterize variation in technology along two dual use dimensions: (1) the ease of distinguishing military from civilian uses; and (2) the degree of integration within military enterprises and the civilian economy. Distinguishability drives the level of monitoring needed to detect violations. When a weapon is indistinguishable from its civilian counterpart, states must improve detection though intelligence collection or intrusive inspections. Integration sharpens the costs of disclosing information to another state. For highly integrated technology, demonstrating compliance could expose information about other capabilities, increasing the security risks from espionage. Together, these dimensions generate expectations about the specific information problems states face as they try to devise agreements over various technologies. We introduce a new qualitative data set to assess both variables and their impact on cooperation across all modern armament technologies. The findings lend strong support for the theory. Efforts to control emerging technologies should consider how variation in the dual use attributes shapes this tension between detection and disclosure.},

	abstract = {Encryption is the process of securing confidential data that bars a third party’s access to the information.RSA encryption utilises the property of complexity classes wherein the problem of prime integer factorization lies inside the Non-Polynomial time (NP-Hard) class, which makes it impervious to classical computers. Since it is so hard to break even for a computer, it becomes important to do encryption for all the secure transactions. Although it lies outside the capabilities of traditional computing, the recent developments in the field of quantum computing can be utilised to break RSA Encryption. The approach involves mapping of qubits used in a quantum machine to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and then using them to check for factors. This consists of the use of a Multiplicative Boolean circuit in which the qubits utilised by the machine replaces the variables. These Qubits are then mapped as per the gates involved, and the factorization problem is thus transformed into a CSP problem, through which, the factors can be easily found. Once known, these factors can be used to calculate the public and private keys effectively breaking the encryption security. We provide a novel approach to highlight the importance of developing Post-Quantum cryptography techniques for providing a secure channel of communication.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, quantum computing is an important topic since it allows computations to be completed in a small amount of the time. The goal of using quantum computers (QC) is to solve an increasing number of problems that were previously intractable to address with traditional computing. The classical approaches work with bits, which are made up of 0s and 1s, whereas QC uses qubits. Classical computing is limited by storage capacity and speed of calculations, even when parallel computation is conducted on it. Compared to traditional methods, quantum parallelism allows the storage to be reduced exponentially with the potential of a shorter amount of time. Besides, Peter Shor's algorithm can solve the factorization problem used in RSA in polynomial time, whereas in a classical computer, factoring any big integer is intractable. The purpose of this research is to explore and implement quantum computing schemes and how Shor's algorithm can break RSA algorithms.},

	abstract = {How do states distribute the burdens of collective defense? This paper develops a network theory of burden sharing. We focus on bilateral defense cooperation agreements (DCAs), which promote cooperation in a variety of defense, military, and security issue areas. Using a computational model, we show that DCA partners’ defense spending depends on the network structure of their agreements. In bilateral terms, DCAs increase defense spending by committing states to defense activities and allowing partners to reciprocally punish free riding. However, as a state’s local network of defense partnerships grows more densely connected, with many transitive “friend of a friend” relations, DCAs have the countervailing effect of reducing defense spending. The more deeply integrated states are in bilateral defense networks, the less they spend on defense. We distinguish two potential mechanisms behind this effect—one based on efficiency improvements, the other on free riding. An empirical analysis using multilevel inferential network models points more to efficiency than to free riding. Defense networks reduce defense spending, and they do so by allowing countries to produce security more efficiently.},

This examination of the means and ends of China's quest for techno-security supremacy is required reading for anyone looking for clues as to the long-term direction of the global order.  The techno-security domain, Cheung argues, is where national security, innovation, and economic development converge, and it has become the center of power and prosperity in the twenty-first century. China's paramount leader Xi Jinping recognizes that effectively harnessing the complex interactions among security, innovation, and development is essential in enabling China to compete for global dominance.  Cheung offers a richly detailed account of how China is building a potent techno-security state. In Innovate to Dominate he takes readers from the strategic vision guiding this transformation to the nuts-and-bolts of policy implementation. The state-led top-down mobilizational model that China is pursuing has been a winning formula so far, but the sternest test is ahead as China begins to compete head-to-head with the United States and aims to surpass its archrival by mid-century if not sooner.  Innovate to Dominate is a timely and analytically rigorous examination of the key strategies guiding China's transformation of its capabilities in the national, technological, military, and security spheres and how this is taking place. Cheung authoritatively addresses the burning questions being asked in capitals around the world: Can China become the dominant global techno-security power? And if so, when?},

The fierce competition between China and the U.S. has already expanded from trade to high-tech protection, regional strategies, and two development models supported by different values.

However, the empirical evidence on the impact of defense R\&D is scant and it does not provide conclusive results on the possible crowding-in (-out) effects on private R\&D investment. Exploiting a longitudinal dataset linking public R\&D obligations to private R\&D expenditures for US states, we investigate the impact of defense R\&D on privately-financed R\&D. To address potential endogeneity in the allocation of funds, we use an instrumental variable identification strategy leveraging the differential exposure of US states to national shocks in federal military R\&D. We document considerable crowding-in effects with elasticities in the 0.11–0.14 range. These positive effects extend also to the labor market, when focusing on employment in selected R\&D intensive industries and especially for engineers.},

It scrutinizes the challenges in creating effective governance structures amidst the AI race, considering diverse global perspectives and policies. The discourse moves beyond specific corporate examples, addressing broader implications and sector-wide impacts of AI on employment, truth discernment, and democratic stability. The analysis focuses on contrasting regulatory approaches across key regions—the United States, European Union, Asia, Africa, and the Americas and thus highlighting the variations and commonalities in strategies and implementations. This comparative study reveals the intricacies and hurdles in formulating a cohesive global policy for AI regulation. Central to the paper is the examination of the dynamic between rapid AI innovation and the slower pace of regulatory and ethical standard-setting. It critically evaluates the advantages and drawbacks of shifting regulatory responsibilities between government bodies and the private sector. In response to these challenges, the discussion proposes an innovative and integrated regulatory model. The model advocates for a collaborative network that blends governmental authority with industry expertise, aiming to establish adaptive, responsive regulations (called “dynamic laws”) that can evolve with technological advancements. The novel approach aims to bridge the gap between rapid AI advancements in the industry and the essential democratic processes of law-making.},

	abstract = {Much has been written about the risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI). This article is interested not only in what is known about these risks, but what remains unknown and how that unknowing is and should be approached. By reviewing and expanding on the scientific literature, it explores how social knowledge contributes to the understanding of AI and its regulatory challenges. The analysis is conducted in three steps. First, the article investigates risks associated with AI and shows how social scientists have challenged technically-oriented approaches that treat the social instrumentally. It then identifies the invisible and visible characteristics of AI, and argues that not only is it hard for outsiders to comprehend risks attached to the technology, but also for developers and researchers. Finally, it asserts the need to better recognise ignorance of AI, and explores what this means for how their risks are handled. The article concludes by stressing that proper regulation demands not only independent social knowledge about the pervasiveness, economic embeddedness and fragmented regulation of AI, but a social non-knowledge that is attuned to its complexity, and inhuman and incomprehensible behaviour. In properly allowing for ignorance of its social implications, the regulation of AI can proceed in a more modest, situated, plural and ultimately robust manner.},

On the side of the expressiveness, we show that existing succinct representations of monotonic TU games can be efﬁciently compiled into TU planning games. On the side of computation, TU planning games allow us to provide some of the strongest to date tractability results for core-existence and core-membership queries in succinct TU coalition games.},

In this essay, I analyze a technology's potential to significantly affect stability along three axes: the pace of advances in, and diffusion of, this technology; the technology's implications for deterrence and defense; and the technology's potential for direct impact on crisis decision-making. I apply this framework to examples including hypersonic weapons, antisatellite weapons, artificial intelligence, and persistent overhead monitoring. Formal arms control to contain dangers posed by some of these seems technically possible, though currently politically difficult to achieve. Others, particularly enabling technologies, resist arms control based on effective verification. The major powers will therefore instead have to find other ways to cope with these technologies and their implications. These options should include exchanges with potential adversaries so that pathways to nuclear escalation, and possible mitigating steps, can be identified and discussed.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing research and development efforts have grown dramatically over the past decades, led in part by initiatives from governments around the world. Government quantum computing investments are often driven by national security or digital sovereignty concerns, with the language used depending on the geography involved. For example, a focus on “national security” and quantum computing is prominent in the USA, while European countries regularly focus on “digital sovereignty”. These phrases are often loosely defined and open to interpretation, and they share some common motivations and characteristics (but also have important differences). This paper identifies specific governmental entities typifying the national security/digital sovereignty perspectives, along with these organisations’ respective roles within national and international policy engagement in quantum computing. It analyses governmental structures, historical developments and cultural characteristics that contributed to this national security–digital sovereignty divide. Building on this analysis, we use the history of other technologies to illustrate how we might adapt tested policy approaches to modern political dynamics and to quantum computing specifically. We frame these policy approaches so that they do not overemphasise “digital sovereignty” or “national security”, but rather address interests shared across both concepts, with a view to facilitating international collaboration.},

Recently many nations have revisited their national cybersecurity strategies (NCSs) to ensure that their cybersecurity capabilities is sufficient to protect their citizens and cyberspace. This study is an initial attempt to compare NCSs by using clustering and topic modelling methods to investigate the similarity and differences between them. We also aimed to identify underlying topics that are appeared in NCSs. We have collected and examined 60 NCSs that have been developed during 20032016. By relying on institutional theories, we found that memberships in the international intuitions could be a determinant factor for harmonization and integration between NCSs. By applying hierarchical clustering method, we noticed a stronger similarities between NCSs that are developed by the EU or NATO members. We also found that public-private partnerships, protection of critical infrastructure, and defending citizen and public IT systems are among those topics that have been received considerable attention in the majority of NCSs. We also argue that topic modeling method, LDA, can be used as an automated technique for analysis and understanding of textual documents by policy makers and governments during the development and reviewing of national strategies and policies.},

While containing similar terminology, these strategies are tailored to the national contexts and hence, differ across regions, cultures, and political contexts. Previous research of these documents has been focused on comparative analysis of countries that can either be considered well developed on this topic or for specific subtopics of cybersecurity. However, some of the subtopics have not been addressed, only now having become more prevalent due to current international conflicts and national / regional socio-political scuffles that have spilled into cyberspace. In our paper, we investigate all countries that have published a National Cyber Security Strategy - NCSS - (or any similar document under a different nomenclature, e.g., policy, decree, etc.), specifically in reference to their position on war, neutrality, and international cooperation. Countries maintaining an NCSS will first be identified using international databases, upon which further study of the aforementioned topics in the NCSSs will occur. We hypothesize, that while international cooperation will be present in most, if not all NCSSs, armed conflicts and neutrality will not be addressed at all nor in depth, in those that contain any reference to them. The resulting paper will present a near-global case study of these topics, which can then signify potential areas of improvement, capacity building, and strengthening of democratic coalitions, globally.},

The study observed that there is not a unified understanding of the term "Cybersecurity"; however, a common trajectory of the NCSSs shows that the fight against cybercrime is a joint effort among various stakeholders, hence the need for strong international cooperation. Using a comparative structure and an NCSS framework, the research finds similarities in protecting critical assets, commitment to research and development, and improved national and international collaboration. The study finds that the lack of a unified underlying cybersecurity framework leads to a disparity in the structure and contents of the strategies. The strengths and weaknesses of the NCSSs from the research can benefit countries planning to develop or update their cybersecurity strategies. The study gives recommendations that strategy developers can consider when developing an NCSS.},

	abstract = {The United States has declared an era of strategic competition with China but how might this rivalry end—assuming a positive outcome for US interests? US policy-makers have chosen not to pick a favoured end state for strategic competition, hoping to maintain flexibility. However, the decision not to choose a termination point could make the rivalry more difficult to resolve. The ‘negativity bias’ in psychology means that threats tend to loom large, limiting the odds of ending strategic competition. This article applies the negativity bias to potential end-state scenarios—China's accommodation of US interests, China's democratization and China's collapse—and shows that none of these scenarios will likely end strategic competition. A study of the resolution of US great power rivalries over the last two centuries suggests there is a high bar to end strategic competition. Washington should choose a favoured end-game for strategic competition and the best option is sustained Chinese reform or ‘accommodation plus’. The negativity bias may powerfully influence the course and resolution of the Sino-US rivalry, and it can also help to explain many wider behaviours in international relations.},

	abstract = {France, for a century, thought of herself as a great industrial nation. This country not only saw a source of prosperity and quality jobs for its citizens but also always considered technological autonomy and industrial power as an attribute of sovereignty. For the classical economist, deindustrialization is a fact of development: the more economies grow and become more sophisticated, the more they produce and consume services, and the more industrial activities migrate to emerging countries. However, in France, the attachment to industry and to an active industrial policy remained strong even as the country gradually embarked on European construction and had to respond to globalization and new technological waves. France has long successfully pursued an industrial policy of major projects. European integration, the ever closer union, the development of regulatory authorities for competition, and state aids led France to dismantle its public intervention apparatus. The introduction of the euro further deprived France of its devaluation power to correct relative competitiveness losses. Thus, France is a pure case of a voluntarist country subjected to the test of globalization intermediated by the European Union whose long-term effects on deindustrialization can be judged.},

Based on the international and comparative political economy literature on China's global externalization, and through research on technical standardization, this article investigates 5G standard setting within formal international standard‐developing organizations and de facto standardization of railways within the Belt and Road Initiative. By triangulating data from interviews, policy documents and other primary and secondary sources, the article systematically analyses China's standardization practices, which also affords insight into the implications for international standardization.},

	abstract = {This thesis is the first study to investigate how the strategic competition over innovative technologies between the United States and China shapes the emergence of the quantum internet. A quantum internet will connect first-generation quantum computers over secure quantum channels to provide and distribute at scale a new type of compute resource that promises better security and a significant speedup of compute power. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The US and China consider emerging technologies in general, and quantum internet technologies in particular, of utmost importance in their efforts to contain their strategic rival. This thesis investigates how the quantum internet is being framed in security terms in this aggravating rivalry, and what this means for the future of the internet. As warnings of the dangers of a fragmented internet increase, the thesis maps out the significant obstacles on the way to maintaining interoperability.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}In an original contribution to research methods, this thesis is the first application of ERGMs to the analysis of patent data and their citation trees in the domain of quantum internet technologies. It conducts a statistical analysis of 4,200 patent family records and the 10,000+ patents they cite. Following a mixed-method approach, this thesis also evaluates a corpus of interviews with GCHQ, the British government and several internet governance and China experts. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}It finds robust evidence for two separate and siloed quantum research programmes in the US and China. These programmes are further characterised internally by significant homophily and the preferential treatment of domestic industries. Findings further suggest a tentative edge for China in the domain of quantum communication, an important technology for realising the quantum internet. China's significant progress in developing components for a quantum internet is found to have great potential to give its increasingly assertive stance on internet governance additional momentum.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The thesis argues that China should be expected to try and offer what may be called 'quantum patronage': a complete package of quantum technology stacks and appropriate standards in line with its recent 'China Standards 2035' plan. Quantum patronage may offer hitherto non-aligned countries critical technologies to secure their communication and build up quantum compute resources in exchange for a commitment to allegiance and strategic alignment.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The empirical findings of this thesis inform the building blocks of a coalitional game theory model of standards-finding for the quantum internet. It recommends the US make side payments to China as compensation for easing its strategic ambitions, in particular around its `New IP' many-nets proposal. The model is a first step towards designing a mechanism for finding a global standard for the future quantum internet. If the fragmentation of the quantum internet is to be avoided, the US and its allies should be prepared to incur new and unexpected political and financial costs to ensure long-term interoperability. Given the empirical evidence that this thesis presents, which points towards fragmentation, this could be a price worth paying for an open quantum internet.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Twenty-five years after its initial formulation, securitization theory is at a crossroads: attempts to critically scrutinize its achievements and shortcomings proliferate, concerns about the theory?s eurocentrism are articulated, and a heated row shakes the field following accusations of racism. In this unstable context, the present article systematically reviews a corpus of 171 securitization papers published in 15 major International Relations journals since 1995, identifying two major imbalances characterizing securitization theory research. First, rich theoretical development has not been matched by sustained efforts to strengthen empirical work; second, the theory has not been globally embraced, displaying instead a narrow, distinctly local anchoring. By shedding light on these two issues and their relationships, this review article aims to provide clear and actionable observations around which scholars could productively re-organize the ongoing debates and controversies.},

	abstract = {Among the many impacts of Russia's war on Ukraine, the most consequential may be in pushing the world in the direction of Three Worlds—the global West, the global East and the global South. One is led by the United States and Europe, the second by China and Russia, and the third by an amorphous grouping of non-western developing nations. These Three Worlds are not blocs or coherent negotiating groups, but loose, constructed and evolving global factions. This article makes four arguments. First, the Three Worlds system has the makings of a fairly durable pattern of global order, shaping struggles over rules and institutions. Second, the Three Worlds system will encourage a ‘creative’ politics of global order-building. The global West and global East will have incentives to compete for the support and cooperation of the global South. Third, there are deep principles of world order that provide a foundation for the Three Worlds competition. Finally, if the global West is to remain at the center of world order in the decades ahead, it will need to accommodate both the global East and the global South, and adapt itself to a more pluralistic world. But in the competition with the global East for the support of the global South, it has the advantage. The global South's critique of the global West is not that it offers the wrong pathway to modernity, but that it has not lived up to its principles or shared sufficiently the material fruits of liberal modernity.},

	abstract = {Europe's security landscape has changed dramatically in the past decade amid Russia's resurgence, mounting doubts about the long-term reliability of the U.S. security commitment, and Europe's growing aspiration for strategic autonomy. This changed security landscape raises an important counterfactual question: Could Europeans develop an autonomous defense capacity if the United States withdrew completely from Europe? The answer to this question has major implications for a range of policy issues and for the ongoing U.S. grand strategy debate in light of the prominent argument by U.S. “restraint” scholars that Europe can easily defend itself. Addressing this question requires an examination of the historical evolution as well as the current and likely future state of European interests and defense capacity. It shows that any European effort to achieve strategic autonomy would be fundamentally hampered by two mutually reinforcing constraints: “strategic cacophony,” namely
profound, continent-wide divergences across all domains of national defense policies—most notably, threat perceptions; and severe military capacity shortfalls that would be very costly and time-consuming to close. As a result, Europeans are highly unlikely to develop an autonomous defense capacity anytime soon, even if the United States were to fully withdraw from the continent.},

	abstract = {Technology sovereignty has become a major concern in science, technology and innovation policy debates in the last years. An intensive discussion has unfolded
as to how countries and the EU should safeguard their abilities to produce and use the technologies needed, based on their own values and independent from
unwanted foreign interference. The EU is lagging in a number of technologies, and is reliant on foreign input of knowledge, technological components and raw material. At the same time, it has been a long-held principle to work towards ever more openness, in particular for science, technology and innovation. Against this background, the chapter aims to shed some light on the specific challenges and opportunities related to technology sovereignty faced at EU level, delving into the conceptual underpinning of the concept and its link with open strategic autonomy and economic security, and current approaches adopted to determine the EU’s sovereignty position. The chapter concludes with a number of considerations towards an effective and efficient technology sovereignty strategy at EU level.},

	abstract = {Domestic politics and international relations are often inextricably entangled, but existing theories (particularly "state-centric" theories) do not adequately account for these linkages. When national leaders must win ratification (formal or informal) from their constituents for an international agreement, their negotiating behavior reflects the simultaneous imperatives of both a domestic political game and an international game. Using illustrations from Western economic summitry, the Panama Canal and Versailles Treaty negotiations, IMF stabilization programs, the European Community, and many other diplomatic contexts, this article offers a theory of ratification. It addresses the role of domestic preferences and coalitions, domestic political institutions and practices, the strategies and tactics of negotiators, uncertainty, the domestic reverberation of international pressures, and the interests of the chief negotiator. This theory of "two-level games" may also be applicable to many other political phenomena, such as dependency, legislative committees, and multiparty coalitions.},

Furthermore, attempts to explain disintegration, notably the new intergovernmentalism, portray these tendencies as idiosyncratically European and dysfunctional. But we can observe disintegration and collective action failure elsewhere, and not all new institution-building is dysfunctional. This paper interprets recent EU institution-building and its limits in light of the concept of two-level games, both in its classic instrumental version of Putnam (1988) and in a more recent normative version developed by Bellamy and Weale (2015). Framing the new economic governance of the EU as the result of two-level games can help us see the specific collective action problems of an incomplete union and the general problems of international cooperation.},

The incentives to conform to the market’s preference were weaker for creditor countries than for debtor countries because debtors were providers of their own macroeconomic policy, but each creditor was one of several contributing to bailouts. Worries about default caused investors to sell the bonds of debtors and thereby constrained debtors by raising interest rates. By contrast, if creditor behaviour reduced the probability of a bailout of debtors, the response again would be to sell assets linked to the debtor. The implication is that market responses to creditor elections should have been larger and more turbulent than reactions to debtor elections. We test this theory by analyzing credit default swaps of eleven countries around fifteen elections and conducting a content analysis of 3,126 reports from Bloomberg terminals.},

	abstract = {This book grows out of the work of a study group convened by the American Branch of the International Law Association. The group had a mandate to examine threats to the rules-based international order and possible responses. The several chapters in the book-all of which are written by distinguished international law scholars--generally support the conclusion that the rules-based international order confronts significant challenges, but it is not unraveling--at least, not yet. Climate change is the biggest wild card in trying to predict the future. If the world's major powers--especially the United States and China--cooperate with each other to combat climate change, then other threats to the rules-based order should be manageable. If the world's major powers fail to address the climate crisis by 2040 or 2050, the other threats addressed in this volume may come to be seen as trivial in comparison.The book consists of fourteen chapters, plus an introduction. Three chapters address specific threats to the rules-based international order: climate change, autonomous weapons, and cyber weapons. Eight chapters address particular substantive areas of international law: jus ad bellum, jus in bello, trade law, investment law, anti-bribery law, human rights law, international criminal law, and migration law. The remaining chapters provide a range of perspectives on the past evolution and likely future development of the rules-based international order as a whole.},

	abstract = {When and why do powerful countries seek to enact major changes to international order, the broad set of rules that guide behavior in world politics? This question is particularly important today given the Trump administration's clear disregard for the reigning liberal international order in the United States. Across the globe, there is also uncertainty over what China might seek to replace that order with as it continues to amass power and influence. Together, these developments mean that what motivates great powers to shape and change order will remain at the forefront of debates over the future of world politics. Prior studies have focused on how the origins of international orders have been consensus-driven and inclusive. By contrast, Kyle M. Lascurettes argues in Orders of Exclusion that the propelling motivation for great power order building has typically been exclusionary. Dominant powers pursue fundamental changes to order when they perceive a major new threat on the horizon. Moreover, they do so for the purpose of targeting this perceived threat, be it another powerful state or a foreboding ideological movement. The goal of foundational rule writing in international relations, then, is blocking that threatening entity from amassing further influence, a motive Lascurettes illustrates at work across more than three hundred years of history. Far from falling outside of the bounds of traditional statecraft, order building is the continuation of power politics by other means.},

Has China's patenting ascendancy been propelled by Chinese firms’ increasing technological sophistication or their much greater propensity to seek patents? Using a unique and never before used data set, where the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) patent records have been matched to their applicant firms by SIPO, we differentiate the two potential explanations by estimating a patent production function and by relating a firm's patents in force to its labor productivity. Our main findings are: 1) while the patenting surge has been an across-the-board phenomenon, most of the growth has come from the extensive margin of growth – firms that were not actively applying for patents in the past; 2) the correlation between patents and R\&D and that between patents and labor productivity have become weaker, particularly for utility models and for the extensive margin of growth. These results suggest that non-innovation related motives for acquiring patents may have played an important role in the patenting surge.},

	abstract = {Recently, users have used open-source intelligence (OSINT) to gather and obtain information regarding the data of interest. The advantage of using data gathered by OSINT is that security threats arising in cyberspace can be addressed. However, if a user uses data collected by OSINT for malicious purposes, information regarding the target of an attack can be gathered, which may lead to various cybercrimes, such as hacking, malware, and a denial-of-service attack. Therefore, from a cybersecurity point of view, it is important to positively use the data gathered by OSINT in a positive manner. If exploited in a negative manner, it is important to prepare countermeasures that can minimize the damage caused by cybercrimes. In this paper, the current status and security trends of OSINT will be explained. Specifically, we present security threats and cybercrimes that may occur if data gathered by OSINT are exploited by malicious users. Furthermore, to solve this problem, we propose security requirements that can be applied to the OSINT environment. The proposed security requirements are necessary for securely gathering and storing data in the OSINT environment and for securely accessing and using the data collected by OSINT. The goal of the proposed security requirements is to minimize the damage when cybercrimes occur in the OSINT environment.},

	abstract = {Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a concept to describe the search, collection, analysis, and use of information from open sources, as well as the techniques and tools used. OSINT emerges out of a military need to collect relevant and publicly available information. Through the use of OSINT, it is possible to find specific information that has some knowledge or provides an advantage. Since its emergence, some studies have been done proposing and developing new ways of using OSINT in different areas. In addition to OSINT, another field of study that has also been a worldwide trend and is being used together with other areas is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is the area of ​​computer science responsible for the development of intelligent systems. However, a systematic literature review that investigates the use of OSINT over the years and your application with AI was not found. So, this work has an objective to develop a systematic literature review on OSINT to investigate the application of OSINT with AI. This work was motivated to fill this research gap, for this, consolidate the publications on OSINT divided into the publication bases. As for its contribution, this work presents a systematic literature review composed of 9-step and also brings consolidated information to support the next OSINT studies. This research searched for publications between January 1990 and October 2019, finding a total of 244 publications. The 9-steps of the systematic literature review are Definition of Keywords, Query string definition, the definition of publication bases, the search on the publications bases, the base search results analysis, download of publications, importing the publications into Mendeley, Importing. Ris file into VOSviewer and Keyword Map Analysis. Analyzing the results, we find some relevant information about the publications that address OSINT and OSINT with AI or other areas. With this information, it was possible to understand where the largest concentration of publications, which countries and continents develop the most research and the characteristics of these publications. What are the trends for the next studies on OSINT with AI. Which AI subareas are used with OSINT. What are the most used keywords, and how do these keywords relate to others over the years. Which publication bases have the highest concentration of publications and what are the types of these publications? Also, a timeline describing the application of OSINT. It also became evident how OSINT has been used with AI to solve problems in different areas with different objectives. Based on these results, it is concluded that the application of a systematic literature review can show the application of OSINT with AI.},

However, existing ML-based methods often struggle to account for the dynamic nature of the technology impact over time and the interdependencies of these impacts across different periods. This study proposes a multi-task learning (MTL) approach to enhance the prediction of technology impact across various time frames by leveraging knowledge sharing and simultaneously monitoring the evolution of technology impact. First, we quantify the technology impacts and identify patterns through citation analysis over distinct time periods. Next, we develop MTL models to predict citation counts using multiple patent indicators over time. Finally, we examine the changes in key input indicators and their patterns over different periods using the SHapley Additive exPlanation method. We also offer guidelines for validating and interpreting the results by employing statistical methods and natural language processing techniques. A case study on battery technologies demonstrates that our approach not only deepens the understanding of technology impact, but also improves prediction accuracy, yielding valuable insights for both academia and industry.},

Statistical significance was performed by ANOVA to identify indicators for these invention patents selected in this research. These selected 8,666 China invention patents were divided into two groups based on their invalidation re-examination decisions during 2000∼2021 in Table 1, which Group 1 included 5,974 invention patents with all valid or partially valid claims, and Group 0 included 2,692 invention patents with all invalid claims. Thereafter, each group was further divided into sub-groups based on 13 major regions where the applicants filed invalidation re-examination. The training sets for Group 1, Group 0 and the sub-groups were selected based on the patent issued in January, February, April, May, July, August, October and November; while the prediction sets were selected from the invention patents issued in March, June, September and December.,The training and prediction accuracies were compared to the existing invalidation re-examination decisions. Accuracies of training sets were ranged from 100\% in region 7 (Beijing) and region 9 (Shanghai) to 95.95\% in region 1 (US), and the average accuracy of invalidation re-examination decisions was 98.95\%. While the accuracies of prediction sets for Group 1 were ranged from 100.00\% in region 7 (Beijing) to 90.78\% in region 13 (Overseas-others), and the average accuracy of classification was 95.96\%, this research’s outcomes confirmed the purpose of applying SVM with RBF to predict the patentability sustainability.,This research developed an empirical method through SVM with RBF to predict patentability sustainability which is crucial for corporate intellectual capital on patents. In particular, the investments on patents are huge, including the patent cultivation and maintenance, developments into products or services, patent litigations and dispute managements. Therefore, this research is beneficial not only for corporation, but also for research organisations to perform cost-effective and profitable patent strategies on intellectual capital.},

The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.},

It explores whether it is necessary to change the current allocation of powers between the EU and Member States to achieve the mentioned objective. It shows that the EU has enacted (or proposed to adopt): i) a number of internal measures to address the EU technological gap in various areas of the EU’s competence, including those in the field of the internal market; ii) unilateral trade measures designed to establish a level playing field for EU operators and to protect Member States’ technological assets. National authorities have also taken unilateral trade measures such as the Dutch decision of March 2023 to establish an export control of chip technology. This measure was enacted at the request of the United States and is based on the need to avoid dependence, on the preservation of technological leadership and on security grounds. It is an attempt to react to China’s strategy (“Made in China 2025”) to close its technological gap in various areas, including semiconductors. The Dutch decision illustrates that the EU institutions and Member States can each exercise their competences and successfully protect Europe’s technological sovereignty (technological leadership) on the basis of a “shared sovereignty”. There is no need to change the Treaty rules to strengthen Europe’s sovereignty. However, it is necessary that Member States inform the Commission and coordinate their actions at EU level.},

	abstract = {Discourses around “strategic autonomy” and “sovereignty”, traditionally used at the state level, have been recently circulated within the EU supranational context regarding the European defence technological and industrial base, dual-use and disruptive research and innovation, and advances in the tech and digital domains. This article explores whether a high-politics logic intrinsic to “strategic autonomy” and “sovereignty” has been transplanted at the EU-level to enhance the strategic priority of various lower-politics policy fields across tech and digital policy initiatives and instruments. This logic has the hegemonic effect of shaping collective thinking and opening windows of opportunity for EU policymaking, by mainstreaming a security imaginary into broader technological governance processes. The article examines the EU’s scaled-up rhetoric around floating signifiers such as “strategic autonomy” and “technological sovereignty”, as well as the diffusion of overlapping “sovereignty” agendas enacted transversely in the defence, tech and digital sectors. The argument is that their meaning is not yet fixed but articulated via hegemonic interventions across different interconnected policy fields. This makes for conceptual “travelling” and “stretching” with a potential impact on the future of European security integration, by creating of a more unified security imaginary of the EU as a strategically independent and technologically sovereign space.},

In a traditional regulatory fashion, the EU has therefore sought to gain more control over third country-based digital intermediaries through legislative solutions regulating its internal market. Although potentially effective in shielding EU citizens from data exploitation by internet giants, this protectionist strategy tells us little about the EU’s ability to develop Digital Sovereignty, beyond its capacity to react to the external tech industry. Given the growing hybridisation of warfare, building on the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the security domain, leadership in advancing AI-related technology has a significant impact on countries’ defence capacity. By framing AI as the intrinsic functioning of algorithms, data mining and computational capacity, we question what tools the EU could rely on to gain sovereignty in each of these dimensions of AI. By focusing on AI from an EU Foreign Policy perspective, we conclude that contrary to the growing narrative, given the absence of a leading AI industry and a coherent defence strategy, the EU has few tools to become a global leader in advancing standards of AI beyond its regulatory capacity.},

A variety of burden-sharing measures are reviewed. These range from such traditional indicators as the share of defence in GDP to a range of alternative military measures as well as civil indicators, such as contributions to UN humanitarian operations and economic aid. Burden-sharing debates are affected by choice of indicator. Different indicators give different rankings and results. Nations will select the indicator(s) which show that they are bearing an `unfairly' high burden of the collective defence effort. The final part of the article examines the likely developments in burden-sharing over the next decade (e.g. new missions, new technology, enlargement). On enlargement, emphasis is placed on the need to assess both the benefits and costs of NATO expansion and the conclusion focuses on the optimal size of NATO.},

We know little about the ideational motivations of Allies to share burdens (or not), or about their deep-seated beliefs, values and principles that (may) guide their burden-sharing practices. Constructivist theorising has the potential to shed light on these questions and help elucidate state motivations, rather than simply treating them as an outcome. Especially practice theoretical approaches could help explain why a particular trend exists (e.g., European free-riding) and why it occurred at a particular point in time, as well as what value rational motivations officials have for - or against - sharing NATO burdens.},

	abstract = {The Burden-Sharing Dilemma examines the conditions under which the United States is willing and able to pressure its allies to assume more responsibility for their own defense. The United States has a mixed track record of encouraging allied burden-sharing―while it has succeeded or failed in some cases, it has declined to do so at all in others. This variation, Brian D. Blankenship argues, is because the United States tailors its burden-sharing pressure in accordance with two competing priorities: conserving its own resources and preserving influence in its alliances. Although burden-sharing enables great power patrons like the United States to lower alliance costs, it also empowers allies to resist patron influence. Blankenship identifies three factors that determine the severity of this burden-sharing dilemma and how it is managed: the latent military power of allies, the shared external threat environment, and the level of a patron's resource constraints. Through case studies of US alliances formed during the Cold War, he shows that a patron can mitigate the dilemma by combining assurances of protection with threats of abandonment and by exercising discretion in its burden-sharing pressure. Blankenship's findings dismantle assumptions that burden-sharing is always desirable but difficult to obtain. Patrons, as the book reveals, can in fact be reluctant to seek burden-sharing, and attempts to pass defense costs to allies can often be successful. At a time when skepticism of alliance benefits remains high and global power shifts threaten longstanding pacts, The Burden-Sharing Dilemma recalls and reconceives the value of burden-sharing and alliances.},

Using an original dataset of presidential statements and NATO defense spending data disaggregated across the four categories tracked by the alliance, we conclude that negative language toward allies’ spending is at best ineffective and may even adversely affect burden-sharing in the long run.

	abstract = {The rise of geostrategic rivalry between the United States and China is changing international cooperation. As China seeks new influence and the United States seeks to contain China and to reduce its own international obligations, three dimensions of multilateralism are becoming particularly important. The first is the management of the superpower rivalry, through formal treaties, informal arrangements among states, and international institutions. The second is the capacity of the leadership of any international institution to foster cooperation beyond the immediate preferences of one or another of the most powerful member states. The third dimension is the legitimacy on which the authority of international institutions rests. The evolution of these three elements will shape the future of multilateralism, by which I refer to the arrangements created and agreed by states which facilitate cooperation by enshrining commitments to diffuse reciprocity and peaceful dispute settlement.The analysis of history and of variations in current practice in international cooperation underscores several ways in which international cooperation could be sustained even as the US-China rivalry strengthens. Global agencies can play a crucial role finding and highlighting areas where cooperation and competition can coexist, and where their own capacities to pool information, to reduce transactions costs, and to broker and monitor agreements can assist. This, in turn, requires high-quality leadership by people who can effectively broker agreements among countries, persuade countries to pool resources, and attract and organize an effective and highly motivated staff. Such leadership requires positive ongoing action by member states, to define what is required for effective leadership of the institutions they collectively create, to seek proven competence in each domain before appointing leaders, and to monitor ongoing performance. Finally, international institutions can buttress their legitimacy by finding better ways to ensure the participation of all stakeholders, and to respond rapidly and effectively to global crises and to provide global public goods.},

Materially weak states are nevertheless expected to participate in IOs since it is generally assumed that they will still profit from cooperation and prefer power to be exercised through institutions. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how exactly institutional rules protect weak states from the powerful in IOs. This paper develops a theory of institutional design that specifies the institutional power equilibrium at the heart of IOs’ constitutional treaties. Through the inclusion of veto or exit rights, weak states obtain formal safeguards against exploitation by the powerful during an IO’s operation. This expectation of a power equilibrium in IOs’ design is borne out in design patterns within the constitutional treaties of IOs created between 1945 and 2005. Our results indicate that the distribution of power among an IO’s founding members indeed affects the inclusion of institutional safeguards in their constitutional treaties and that veto and exit rights are functional substitutes in this regard. Our findings matter since the institutional power equilibrium at IO creation has important implications for relations between the materially powerful and the weak during IO operations.},

Despite much debate on the crisis of liberal international order, contestation, loss of legitimacy, gridlock, pathologies and exiting member states, there is little research on IO decline. This article seeks to clarify this concept and argues that decline can be considered in absolute and relative terms. Absolute decline involves a decrease in the number of IOs and their authority, membership and output, whereas relative decline concerns a decrease in the centrality of IOs in international relations. Reviewing a wide range of indicators, this article argues that, whereas there is limited decline in absolute terms since 1945, there may well be important decline in relative terms. Relative decline is more difficult to measure, but to probe its significance this article presents data from speeches during the United Nations General Assembly General Debate. It shows that IOs were most often mentioned in 1996 and that there has been a decline since. These findings indicate that, whereas IOs might survive as institutions, they are decreasingly central to international relations.},

	abstract = {In recent years, global technology-based competition has not only intensified, but become increasingly linked to a more comprehensive type of competition between different political and value systems. The globalist assumptions of the post-Cold War era that reliable mutually beneficial agreements could be reached with all nations, regardless of ideology, have been shattered. A previously less visible, mostly political, risk dimension has been brought to the fore by recent geopolitical and geo-economic developments. Against this background, the notion of technology sovereignty has gained prominence in national and international debates, cutting across and adding to established rationales of innovation policy. In this paper, we propose and justify a concise yet nuanced concept of technology sovereignty to contribute to and clarify this debate. In particular, we argue that technology sovereignty should be conceived as state-level agency within the international system, i.e. as sovereignty of governmental action, rather than (territorial) sovereignty over something. Against this background, we define technology sovereignty not as an end in itself, but as a means to achieving the central objectives of innovation policy - sustaining national competitiveness and building capacities for transformative policies. By doing so, we position ourselves between a naive globalist position which largely neglects the risks of collaboration and the promotion of near autarky which disregards the inevitable costs of creating national redundancies and reducing cooperative interdependencies. We finish by providing a set of policy suggestions to support technology sovereignty in line with our conceptual approach.},

Observers disagree, however, about the reasons why European governments have chosen to coordinate core economic policies and surrender sovereign prerogatives. In this eagerly awaited book, Andrew Moravcsik analyzes the history of the region's movement toward economic and political union. Do these unifying steps demonstrate the preeminence of national security concerns, the power of federalist ideals, the skill of political entrepreneurs like Jean Monnet and Jacques Delors, or the triumph of technocratic planning? Moravcsik rejects such views. Economic interdependence has been, he maintains in his provocative argument, the primary force compelling these democracies to move in this surprising direction. Politicians rationally pursued national economic advantage through the exploitation of asymmetrical interdependence and the manipulation of institutional commitments.Focusing on Germany, France, and Britain, Moravcsik examines the five decisive agreements that propelled integration forward. He seeks to reintegrate the historical study of European unity with theoretical inquiry into the sources of international cooperation.},

power relations. This does not explain how states increasingly “weaponize interdependence”
by leveraging global networks of informational and financial exchange for strategic
advantage. The theoretical literature on network topography shows how standard models
predict that many networks grow asymmetrically so that some nodes are far more connected
than others. This model nicely describes several key global economic networks, centering
on the United States and a few other states. Highly asymmetric networks allow states with
(1) effective jurisdiction over the central economic nodes and (2) appropriate domestic
institutions and norms to weaponize these structural advantages for coercive ends. In
particular, two mechanisms can be identified. First, states can employ the “panopticon
effect” to gather strategically valuable information. Second, they can employ the
“chokepoint effect” to deny network access to adversaries. Tests of the plausibility of
these arguments across two extended case studies that provide variation both in the extent
of U.S. jurisdiction and in the presence of domestic institutions—the SWIFT financial
messaging system and the internet—confirm the framework's expectations. A better
understanding of the policy implications of the use and potential overuse of these tools,
as well as the response strategies of targeted states, will recast scholarly debates on
the relationship between economic globalization and state coercion.},

The main argument of this article is that the governance of semiconductors is shaped by an inherent tension. On the one hand, this governance is embedded in the agenda of digital sovereignty, suggesting some form of autarky is possible. On the other hand, the production of semiconductors is necessarily globally distributed. This study draws on critical infrastructure literature, which enables us to explore how semiconductors are loaded with values that are inscribed via digital sovereignty. In the case of semiconductors, digital sovereignty works as a tool for legitimising trade, economic and research policies. The need for a strong semiconductor industry in the EU and the globalised nature of threats against the supply chain are acknowledged simultaneously. In turn, subsidising global corporations has turned out to be the natural response. Politically, it becomes difficult to contest these subsidies, as well as the underlying assumption concerning future innovation.},

But because such ‘AI sovereignty’ could be used for diverse and even conflicting goals, it obscures the tensions that actual EU AI strategy entails. Conceptually, this article proposes three central trade-offs: first, does AI sovereignty pit the EU against other major AI powers, or rather citizens against large tech companies? Second, is AI sovereignty meant to boost the EU’s position in a putative AI race, or is it a means to defy this competitiveness-logic, instead? And third, is EU AI sovereignty primarily meant to benefit European citizens, or does it embrace a global responsibility? The empirical analysis then maps the EU Commission’s AI strategy since 2018 and the EU AI Act negotiations onto these three dimensions. It reveals that EU AI policy prioritises jurisdictional independence over citizens sovereignty, that it embraces a global AI race logic, and that it largely neglects its impact on people beyond the EU. This orientation of EU AI sovereignty resonates with and feeds into rising geo-economic tensions. But it would underestimate the importance of public policy to assume that it flowed naturally from technological transformations, rather than from political choices.},

While they find policy change towards more control of the digital across all policy areas examined, this shift is only sometimes accompanied by discursive change towards digital sovereignty.

	abstract = {The fear of falling behind has been a driving force of European integration. Historically, Europe’s response to the looming angst of declining competitiveness has been more market-creation, not market-direction. Recently, however, Europe has – in the name of safeguarding Europe’s technological sovereignty – taken on a much more active role in directing economic activity towards sectors and technologies deemed geopolitically or geoeconomically important. In this paper, we attempt to explain this ‘geo-dirigiste’ turn. We reconstruct the evolution of EU industrial policy through the lens of Europe’s fear of falling behind, drawing not only on primary (including archival) and secondary sources, but also on original interviews and deep transfer learning applied to an original dataset of 66.548 documents. Focusing on Europe’s changing technological and geopolitical context, its coalitional underpinnings, and the role of ideational politics, we document and explain the historic shift away from market-creation and towards supranational market-direction in EU industrial policy.},

	abstract = {International organisations (IOs) have never been more authoritative and potentially agential while simultaneously faced more intense threats to their continued existence. Amid these dialectic conditions, this article identifies a novel type of behaviour: IO Survival Politics. IO Survival Politics occurs when senior institutional actors perceive the organisation to face an existential threat and, in response, employ extraordinary strategies to ensure the organisation’s continued existence. Survival Politics thus differs both in degree and kind from the ways in which secretariats exercise influence during conditions of normal policymaking. Two case studies illustrate the concept: (1) the European Commission’s response to Brexit and (2) NATO’s response to President Trump’s withdrawal threats. Drawing on 87 interviews with senior officials, the article shows that IO Survival Politics occurs across a range of diverse IOs in face of diverse threats and can be a crucial factor in determining the fate of IOs in crisis. By conceptualising IO Survival Politics, the article intends to open new avenues for research and advance scholarly understanding of IOs and the crisis of multilateralism.},

This article examines how the DND/CAF quantum strategies have been implemented over recent years and identifies how the approach to quantum science and technology has become more threat-focused. Through a mixed-method discourse analysis of these strategic documents, we argue that there is a transition of the Canadian stance from viewing quantum science and technology as a neutral space with opportunities and threats, to a more dangerous domain. We conclude that there is a significant intensification of threat language, discuss potential explanatory factors, and sketch out further research areas.},

Our analysis reveals that Canada's quantum strategy focuses on fostering the identification, development, and commercialization of technologies for economic gain at national, regional, and international levels. Both provincial and federal governments actively collaborate with research institutions and businesses within four distinct research and innovation hubs to establish “quantum zones” as emerging paradiplomatic actors. Internationally, Canada is positioning itself as a leader in quantum technology through grants, research and development partnerships, and country-specific Trade Missions with like-minded states. This commentary highlights the need to embed values, such as sustainability and equitability, into the development and application of quantum technologies and future iterations of the NQS to address societal impacts.},

QKD technology cannot replace the flexible authentication mechanisms provided by contemporary public key signatures.

The nature of dominant coalitions in both countries provides a conceptual anchor for understanding the links between internal and external politics in 1914 and 2014. Coalitional dynamics draw greater attention to agency in debates that all too often emphasize structure, impersonal forces, and inevitability. Two core claims rest on this basic analytical building block. First, despite apparent similarities in domestic coalitional arrangements of putative revisionist challengers—Germany and China—important differences defy facile analogies. China now is not Germany then. Second, the regional coalitional cluster and the global political economy—and hence the links between domestic and external politics—differ across the two periods. The “world-time” against which coalitions operate today is significantly different as well. Thus ahistorical analogies between then and now may not only be imperfect; they can infuse actors with misguided and perilous protocols for international behavior. There is plenty that may recall World War I today but even more that does not, and all must make sure that gap never narrows.},

Here we report on the design and implementation of an architecture capable of executing quantum network applications on quantum processors in platform-independent high-level software. We demonstrate the capability of the architecture to execute applications in high-level software by implementing it as a quantum network operating system—QNodeOS—and executing test programs, including a delegated computation from a client to a server13 on two quantum network nodes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond14,15. We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware by multitasking different applications. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an extra driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single 40Ca+ atom16.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2503.10007},
	abstract = {Quantum computing is rapidly advancing toward cloud-based services, raising significant concerns about the privacy and security of computations outsourced to untrusted quantum servers. Traditional Blind Quantum Computation (BQC) protocols enable clients with limited quantum resources to delegate computations while concealing both inputs and circuit details. However, applying BQC uniformly to an entire quantum circuit incurs additional quantum resources and computational overhead, which can be a significant burden in practical implementations. In many cases, such as Grover's algorithm, only specific subroutines-like oracles-contain sensitive information, while the rest of the circuit does not require the same level of protection. Therefore, selectively applying BQC to critical components can enhance computational efficiency while maintaining security. In this work, we propose a selective application of BQC that targets only the critical components of quantum circuits. By integrating techniques from Quantum Homomorphic Encryption (QHE) and Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC), our approach secures the sensitive subcircuits while allowing the remaining, non-sensitive portions to be executed more efficiently. In our framework, BQC-protected sections output quantum states that are encrypted via bit-flip and phase-flip operations, and we devise a mechanism based on selective X and Z gate corrections to seamlessly interface these with unprotected sections. We provide a security analysis demonstrating that our selective BQC approach preserves universality, correctness, and blindness, and we illustrate its practical advantages through an application to Grover's algorithm. This work paves the way for more efficient and practical secure quantum computing on near-term devices.},

	abstract = {We introduce a secure hardware device named a QEnclave that can secure the remote execution of quantum operations while only using classical controls. This device extends to quantum computing from the classical concept of a secure enclave that isolates a computation from its environment to provide privacy and tamper-resistance. Remarkably, our QEnclave only performs single qubit rotations but can nevertheless be used to secure an arbitrary quantum computation even if the qubit source is controlled by an adversary. More precisely, by attaching a QEnclave to a quantum computer, a remote client controlling the QEnclave can securely delegate its computation to the server solely using classical communication. We investigate the security of our QEnclave by modeling it as an ideal functionality named remote state rotation (RSR). We show that this resource, similar to the previously introduced functionality of remote state preparation, allows blind delegated quantum computing with perfect security. Our proof under the Abstract Cryptography framework shows the construction of remote state preparation from remote state rotation while preserving security. An immediate consequence is the weakening of the requirements for blind delegated computation. While previous delegated protocols relied on a client that can either generate or measure quantum states, we show that this same functionality can be achieved with a client that only transforms quantum states without generating or measuring them.},

We present a review of the progress to date in this emerging area.},

	abstract = {Most quantum communication tasks need to rely on the transmission of quantum signals over long distances. Unfortunately, transmission of such signals is most often limited by losses in the channel, the same issue that affects classical communication. Simple signal amplification provides an elegant solution for the classical world, but this is not possible in the quantum world, as the no-cloning theorem forbids such an operation and, thus, an alternative approach, a quantum repeater, is needed. Quantum repeaters enable one to create a known maximally entangled state between the end points of the network by first segmenting the network into pieces, creating entanglement between the segments, and then, connecting those entanglement to create the required long range entanglement. Quantum teleportation then allows an unknown quantum message to be transmitted between them using the long-range entangled state. This form of quantum communication will be at the heart of the future quantum Internet. In this review, we will detail various approaches to quantum repeaters, and discuss their expected performance and limitations.},

Quantum teleportation is facilitated by the action of quantum entanglement, a somewhat counter-intuitive physical phenomenon with no direct counterpart in the classical word. As a consequence, the very concept of the classical communication system model has to be redesigned to account for the peculiarities of quantum teleportation. This re-design is a crucial prerequisite for constructing any effective quantum communication protocol. The aim of this manuscript is to shed light on this key concept, with the objective of allowing the reader: i) to appreciate the fundamental differences between the transmission of classical information versus the teleportation of quantum information; ii) to understand the communications functionalities underlying quantum teleportation, and to grasp the challenges in the design and practical employment of these functionalities; iii) to acknowledge that quantum information is subject to the deleterious effects of a noise process termed as quantum decoherence. This imperfection has no direct counterpart in the classical world; iv) to recognize how to contribute to the design and employment of the Quantum Internet.},

	abstract = {Quantum communication brings radically new capabilities that are provably impossible to attain in any classical network. Here, we take the first step from a physics experiment to a quantum internet system. We propose a functional allocation of a quantum network stack, and construct the first physical and link layer protocols that turn ad-hoc physics experiments producing heralded entanglement between quantum processors into a well-defined and robust service. This lays the groundwork for designing and implementing scalable control and application protocols in platform-independent software. To design our protocol, we identify use cases, as well as fundamental and technological design considerations of quantum network hardware, illustrated by considering the state-of-the-art quantum processor platform available to us (Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond). Using a purpose built discrete-event simulator for quantum networks, we examine the robustness and performance of our protocol using extensive simulations on a supercomputing cluster. We perform a full implementation of our protocol in our simulator, where we successfully validate the physical simulation model against data gathered from the NV hardware. We first observe that our protocol is robust even in a regime of exaggerated losses of classical control messages with only little impact on the performance of the system. We proceed to study the performance of our protocols for 169 distinct simulation scenarios, including trade-offs between traditional performance metrics such as throughput, and the quality of entanglement. Finally, we initiate the study of quantum network scheduling strategies to optimize protocol performance for different use cases.},

Nowhere is this better illustrated than on the Internet, where it is an inherent characteristic of the network that laws, and the conduct to which those laws are directed, will cross national borders. Thus momentum has developed to bring multi-stakeholder governance to the Internet, through reforms such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF). In this groundbreaking and incisive book, Jeremy Malcolm examines the new model of multi-stakeholder governance for the Internet regime that the IGF represents, and builds a compelling case for its reform to enable it to fulfil its mandate as an institution for multi-stakeholder Internet governance.},

Three trends are increasing the risks to undersea cables' security and resilience: First, authoritarian governments, especially in Beijing, are reshaping the Internet's physical layout through companies that control Internet infrastructure, to route data more favorably, gain better control of internet chokepoints, and potentially gain espionage advantage. Second, more companies that manage undersea cables are using network management systems to centralize control over components (such as reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs) and robotic patch bays in remote network operations centers), which introduces new levels of operational security risk. Third, the explosive growth of cloud computing has increased the volume and sensitivity of data crossing these cables. The US government, therefore, has a new opportunity and responsibility--in coordination with the US private sector and with allies and partners abroad--to significantly increase its involvement in protecting the security and resilience of undersea cables},

	abstract = {BGP prefix hijacking is a critical threat to Internet organizations and users. Despite the availability of several defense approaches (ranging from RPKI to popular third-party services), none of them solves the problem adequately in practice. In fact, they suffer from: (i) lack of detection comprehensiveness, allowing sophisticated attackers to evade detection, (ii) limited accuracy, especially in the case of third-party detection, (iii) delayed verification and mitigation of incidents, reaching up to days, and (iv) lack of privacy and of flexibility in post-hijack counteractions, on the side of network operators. In this work, we propose ARTEMIS (Automatic and Real-Time dEtection and MItigation System), a defense approach (a) based on accurate and fast detection operated by the AS itself, leveraging the pervasiveness of publicly available BGP monitoring services and their recent shift towards real-time streaming, thus (b) enabling flexible and fast mitigation of hijacking events. Compared to previous work, our approach combines characteristics desirable to network operators such as comprehensiveness, accuracy, speed, privacy, and flexibility. Finally, we show through real-world experiments that, with the ARTEMIS approach, prefix hijacking can be neutralized within a minute.},

While this popular view does not tell the whole story behind the early beginnings of IXPs, what is true is that since around 1994, the number of operational IXPs worldwide has grown to more than 300 (as of May 2013), with the largest IXPs handling daily traffic volumes comparable to those carried by the largest Tier-1 ISPs, but IXPs have never really attracted any attention from the networking research community. At first glance, this lack of interest seems understandable as IXPs have apparently little to do with current "hot" topic areas such as data centers and cloud services or software defined networking (SDN) and mobile communication. However, we argue in this article that, in fact, IXPs are all about data centers and cloud services and even SDN and mobile communication and should be of great interest to networking researchers interested in understanding the current and future Internet ecosystem. To this end, we survey the existing but largely unknown sources of publicly available information about IXPs to describe their basic technical and operational aspects and highlight the critical differences among the various IXPs in the different regions of the world, especially in Europe and North America. More importantly, we illustrate the important role that IXPs play in today's Internet ecosystem and discuss how IXP-driven innovation in Europe is shaping and redefining the Internet marketplace, not only in Europe but increasingly so around the world.},

	abstract = {“For an engineer determined to refine and secure Internet operation or to explore alternative solutions to persistent problems, the insights provided by this book will be invaluable.”―Vint Cerf, Internet pioneerTCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1, Second Edition,is a detailed and visual guide to today’s TCP/IP protocol suite. Fully updated for the newest innovations, it demonstrates each protocol in action through realistic examples from modern Linux, Windows, and Mac OS environments. There’s no better way to discover why TCP/IP works as it does, how it reacts to common conditions, and how to apply it in your own applications and networks.Building on the late W. Richard Stevens’ classic first edition, author Kevin R. Fall adds his cutting-edge experience as a leader in TCP/IP protocol research, updating the book to fully reflect the latest protocols and best practices. He first introduces TCP/IP’s core goals and architectural concepts, showing how they can robustly connect diverse networks and support multiple services running concurrently. Next, he carefully explains Internet addressing in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Then, he walks through TCP/IP’s structure and function from the bottom up: from link layer protocols–such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi–through network, transport, and application layers.Fall thoroughly introduces ARP, DHCP, NAT, firewalls, ICMPv4/ICMPv6, broadcasting, multicasting, UDP, DNS, and much more. He offers extensive coverage of reliable transport and TCP, including connection management, timeout, retransmission, interactive data flow, and congestion control. Finally, he introduces the basics of security and cryptography, and illuminates the crucial modern protocols for protecting security and privacy, including EAP, IPsec, TLS, DNSSEC, and DKIM. Whatever your TCP/IP experience, this book will help you gain a deeper, more intuitive understanding of the entire protocol suite so you can build better applications and run more reliable, efficient networks.},

	isbn = {978-0-262-54770-3},
	abstract = {Why the Internet was designed to be the way it is, and how it could be different, now and in the future.How do you design an internet? The architecture of the current Internet is the product of basic design decisions made early in its history. What would an internet look like if it were designed, today, from the ground up? In this book, MIT computer scientist David Clark explains how the Internet is actually put together, what requirements it was designed to meet, and why different design decisions would create different internets. He does not take today's Internet as a given but tries to learn from it, and from alternative proposals for what an internet might be, in order to draw some general conclusions about network architecture.Clark discusses the history of the Internet, and how a range of potentially conflicting requirements—including longevity, security, availability, economic viability, management, and meeting the needs of society—shaped its character. He addresses both the technical aspects of the Internet and its broader social and economic contexts. He describes basic design approaches and explains, in terms accessible to nonspecialists, how networks are designed to carry out their functions. (An appendix offers a more technical discussion of network functions for readers who want the details.) He considers a range of alternative proposals for how to design an internet, examines in detail the key requirements a successful design must meet, and then imagines how to design a future internet from scratch. It's not that we should expect anyone to do this; but, perhaps, by conceiving a better future, we can push toward it.},

	shorttitle = {The {ARPAnet} {Sourcebook}},
	abstract = {In the early days of computer networking IBM mainframes could only connect to other IBM mainframes, Burroughs only to other Burroughs, etc. Beginning in 1967 the US Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) office sponsored development of a "heterogeneous" network compatible with computers from any manufacturer. That R\&D effort, one of the most successful in history, resulted in the on-time, on-budget construction of the revolutionary ARPANET, the immediate predecessor of today's Internet. The ARPANET Sourcebook: The Unpublished Foundations of the Internet reproduces the seminal papers, reports, and RFCs that led to the birth of modern network computing. Most appear here in book form for the first time. Part A, Imagining the ARPANET, covers the initial studies of network feasibility and includes: the introductory and concluding chapters of Paul Baran's seminal but little-known RAND research report On Distributed Communications in which packet switching was first conceptualized. the classic 1968 paper The Computer as a Communication Device by J.C.R. Licklider and Robert Taylor, respectively the ARPANET's earliest proponent and the ARPA administrator who pushed the development project. Part B, Planning the ARPANET includes: scans of the earliest RFCs ("Requests for Comments"), some publicly available here for the first time. RFCs were in effect the design documents for the ARPANET and later the Internet. the 1968 ARPA-commissioned SRI study that modeled a heterogeneous network and concluded that it was indeed feasible. forewords by Steve Crocker (author of RFC \#1) and Leonard Kleinrock (noted author and head of the UCLA computing lab that hosted the first ARPANET node). Part C, Building the ARPANET, reproduces the quarterly technical reports from the government's contractor Bolt Beranek and Newman contemporaneously describing the development group's progress, difficulties encountered, and final success. Dave Walden, former BBN VP and a key member of the ARPANET team, has contributed a retrospective Foreword. Other noteworthy material: historical perspectives from Peter Salus, Robert Taylor, Willis Ware, Michael Padlipsky, and Les Earnest, and a long-forgotten RFC which anticipated JAVA by more than 20 years.},

Unlike past technologies, AI systems built using techniques like deep learning cannot be directly analyzed, specified, or audited against regulations. Their behavior emerges unpredictably from training rather than intentional design. However, the traditional model of delegating oversight to an expert agency, which has succeeded in high-risk sectors like aviation and nuclear power, should not be wholly discarded. Instead, policymakers must contain risks from today’s opaque models while supporting research into provably safe AI architectures. Drawing lessons from AI safety literature and past regulatory successes, effective AI governance will likely require consolidated authority, licensing regimes, mandated training data and modeling disclosures, formal verification of system behavior, and the capacity for rapid intervention.},

	abstract = {A Foreign Affairs Best Book of 2024Why has Japan emerged from the “lost decades” unscathed from the populist wave and a far more consequential actor in the geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific? In answering this question, Japan’s Quiet Leadership provides a sweeping look at Japan’s domestic economic and political evolution, its economic statecraft, and the array of geopolitical challenges that have triggered a gradual but substantial shift in the country’s security profile. This deep dive into Japan’s trajectory over the last three decades underscores Japan’s hidden strengths in its democratic resilience, social stability, and proactive diplomacy; while reckoning with the profound challenges the nation faces: depopulation, rising inequality, voter disengagement, and threats to Asia’s long peace. The book traces the profound currents of change coursing through the Japanese polity and its external environment; and the myriad ways in which Japan’s experience has become more relevant to countries coping with slow growth, adverse demographics, adjustment to economic globalization, and the emergence of a powerful and assertive China. This is a story of Japan’s reinvention as a network power to overcome the harsh realities of diminishing relative capabilities. In reshaping the Indo-Pacific, Tokyo deployed a robust economic strategy of trade integration and infrastructure finance; and a proactive security diplomacy cultivating new partnerships with regional and extra-regional actors and deepening the alliance with the United States. Nevertheless, acute geopolitical rifts, Japan’s pandemic insularity, and the securitization of international economic relations are testing Japan’s statecraft of connectivity. The tasks at home are no less pressing: delivering on the green, digital, and human capital transformations, avoiding the return of the politics of indecision at the helm of the nation, and fostering democratic dynamism. This book illuminates where the Japanese polity, economy, and people are heading as we move past the Abe era, and well into the 2020s and beyond.},

	abstract = {Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan’s vaccine diplomacy in Southeast Asia has gained much traction as regional countries are wrestling with a dual challenge, i.e., navigating the pandemic and seeking economic recovery and growth. Japan’s donation of coronavirus vaccine shots to Southeast Asian countries confronting this severe pandemic is one expression of Tokyo’s strategic approach towards the region: helping regional countries in need and buttressing its status as a responsible stakeholder. What should deserve attention is that Tokyo has sought a more robust status with its niche diplomacy, the signature characteristic of middle powers, while keeping a low profile in its support for regional countries. The paper argues that as Japan is becoming more committed to the Indo-Pacific region in general and Southeast Asia specifically, Tokyo’s niche diplomacy of vaccine donations has sought to win the hearts and minds of regional countries. The non-traditional approach can foster Japan’s status in Southeast Asia and widen its maneuvering space amid China’s growing assertiveness. Japan’s diplomatic statecraft portrayed via Tokyo’s vaccine diplomacy in Southeast Asia may provide emerging middle powers with valuable lessons on strengthening their influence.},

Races motivated by prestige can diﬀer in the material objects states invest in, when they are most likely to occur and which states becomes involved. The article illustrates these dynamics in the important case of the Space Race between the United States and Soviet Union beginning in 1957. Often erroneously understood by political scientists as an extension of traditional security competition during the Cold War, the Space Race instead oﬀers an ideal case for the study of how prestige aﬀects the dynamics of international competition, dynamics which have important implications for our understanding of the rapidly emerging competitive environment of today.

However, the literature has remained oddly quiet about the status symbols acquired and used to further that goal. To redress this lacuna, this special issue brings together several of IR’s leading status scholars to investigate the emergence, decline, ambiguity, functionality, and utility of status symbols in world politics. This introduction lays out the analytical and ethical warrant for studying status symbols. We formulate an interpretive framework for historicizing status symbols and exploring their temporal and spatial trajectories within international society. Specifically, this introduction develops four analytical lenses for illuminating status symbols. In short, how status symbols temporally rise to prominence and eventually whiter, how and whether they function and thus how they are received, whether their inherent multivocality enable them to cut across multiple groups of world politics, and how and to what extent status symbols can be consciously manipulated into a force for good.},

Securing cooperation from China and Russia poses special problems, however, because neither state is part of the liberal Western community, ruling out appeals to common values and norms. Nevertheless, an alternative approach that is rooted in appreciation of China's and Russia's heightened status concerns may be viable. Since the end of the Cold War, Chinese and Russian foreign policy has been shaped by the goal of restoring both countries' great power status, which received major blows after China's Tiananmen Square repression and the Soviet Union's breakup and loss of empire. This desire for status can be explained by social identity theory, which argues that social groups strive for a distinctive, positive identity. Social identity theory provides a typology of strategies that states may use to enhance their relative status and suggests appropriate responses to status concerns of rising powers. Redirecting scholarly attention to status considerations and incentives could contribute to a diplomatic strategy for engaging rising powers.},

The deep interpretive dive into small-s status politics presented here raises intriguing questions even for those scholars still wedded to a positivist great power agenda. Three payoffs stand out: First, status-seeking via the acquisition of status symbols can be a rational choice. Second, the collection suggests the importance of clarifying types of status symbols as well as a rough and ready method for doing so—an argument I seek to flesh out through an examination of the emerging aircraft carrier race. Third, many other important questions for further inquiry emerge, questions I doubt would have come to the fore but for the efforts of Beaumuont, Røren, and their collaborators.},

This results in a thin and limited understanding of what ‘status-seeking’ is, where it works, and how it is effected. This article challenges the existing approaches by introducing a performativity framework and offers an overhaul of how ‘status’ can be studied. It suggests replacing ‘status-seeking’ with ‘status performances’ that are conceptualised as part of ‘statecraft’ process. Drawing on post-structuralist and queer approaches as well as aesthetics in International Relations (IR), it is argued that status performances participate in the production of the state itself as a subject in world politics, so all states are ‘status-seekers’. This subject-production process occurs in multiple political sites, including the academic IR discourse in a country and visual presentations in the media. It is concluded that there is no ‘status’ beyond the subject, and status can never be achieved because it always needs repetitive performances. The argument is illustrated by an analysis of the production of ‘Turkey’ as a humanitarian state and demonstrates how this is effected in state-elite pronouncements, IR scholarship in Turkey, and visual representations.},

The article contrasts and compares the three works. Moreover, it identifies shortcomings and limitations in each book and, based on this discussion, suggests areas for further research. In particular, it is argued that scholars should devote more attention to competitive theory testing through process tracing; incorporate domestic politics more systematically into approaches of status seeking; develop case-specific explanations that fuse insights from the various perspectives; and examine how the interplay of material and ideational factors shapes states’ status aspirations.},

I review the literature on status in IR and introduce the concept of status orders as context-specific and local social structures that determine what is considered prestigious within a particular group, community, or club. Using examples from war-making, nuclear weapons, and diplomatic practice, I argue that the fact that status dynamics is often produced locally and not globally forces us to focus less on “universal” aspirations for status, and more on where that actor sought status from and eventually according to which yardstick that actor experienced a change in status.},

To help overcome these challenges, this review offers a general conceptual framework that integrates their strategic, cultural, and psychological logics. We summarize important findings and open questions, including (a) whether leaders care about their reputations and status, (b) how to address the tension between instrumental and intrinsic motives, (c) how observers draw inferences, (d) to whom and across what contextual breadth these inferences apply, and (e) how these relate to domestic audience costs.

The desire for status is recognized as a key factor in nuclear proliferation, the rise of China, and other contemporary foreign policy issues, and has long been implicated in foundational theories of international relations and foreign policy. Despite the consensus that status matters, we lack a basic understanding of status dynamics in international politics. The first book to comprehensively examine this subject, Fighting for Status presents a theory of status dissatisfaction that delves into the nature of prestige in international conflicts and specifies why states want status and how they get it.What actions do status concerns trigger, and what strategies do states use to maximize or salvage their standing? When does status matter, and under what circumstances do concerns over relative position overshadow the myriad other concerns that leaders face? In examining these questions, Jonathan Renshon moves beyond a focus on major powers and shows how different states construct status communities of peer competitors that shift over time as states move up or down, or out, of various groups.Combining innovative network-based statistical analysis, historical case studies, and a lab experiment that uses a sample of real-world political and military leaders, Fighting for Status provides a compelling look at the causes and consequences of status on the global stage.},

This article constitutes both an Introduction and an individual contribution to a Special Issue that examines recent shifts in the security-innovation nexus and its relation to geopolitical imaginations. Here, we propose to conceptualise the nexus along three lines – as an empirical phenomenon, a set of problems confronting security actors, and as an analytical approach. We then map the tensions between security and innovation rationalities before introducing the contributions to this Issue and their individual approaches to studying the security-innovation nexus. We conclude by discussing how the ‘innovationization’ of security reshapes security practices, co-constitutes new actors, and restructures the spaces – imagined and actual – in which they operate.},

However, the analytical differences between concepts like strategic narratives, master narratives, frames, framing and master frames have been rarely investigated through a comprehensive approach. Very different definitions and perspectives have been adopted in the IR scholarly debate and beyond, while few studies have identified how ideologies underlie frames and narratives. This article aims at filling this gap and makes two claims. First, the process of plot formation, their strategic dimension and the levels at which narratives operate are the special features that distinguish strategic narratives from all other concepts. Second, only by unpacking – from an interdisciplinary perspective – the complex relation between ideology and narratives can we understand the proper conceptual boundaries in the narrative literature. In sum, there are four levels of discourse to be considered: frame, strategic narrative, master narrative and ideology.},

This paper seeks to identify how anticipation is defined and understood in the literature and to explore the role of anticipatory practice to address individual, social, and global challenges. We use a resilience lens to examine these questions. We illustrate how varying forms of anticipatory governance are enhanced by multi-scale regional networks and technologies and by the agency of individuals, drawing from an empirical case study on regional water governance of Mälaren, Sweden. Finally, we discuss how an anticipatory approach can inform adaptive institutions, decision making, strategy formation, and societal resilience.},

Drawing on prior OECD work and legal instruments, this framework equips governments, other innovation actors and societies to anticipate and get ahead of governance challenges and build longer-term capacities to shape innovation more effectively. Its “anticipatory technology governance” approach consists of five interdependent elements and associated governance tools: (1) guiding values, (2) strategic intelligence, (3) stakeholder engagement, (4) agile regulation and (5) international co-operation.

Recently, various frameworks of AG have been introduced, but there is little practical information available for newcomers on how to do this. This research conducted a framework-based comparative country analysis to provide lessons learned for newcomers in the sphere of foresight-linked AG. By evaluating the AG levels of Finland, the UK, the Netherlands, and Korea, we found that the consequences of foresight-linked AGs were different in each country. At the same time, we also identified a common denominator, namely, future receptivity, a “human or people” capacity to accept and understand the value of foresight. Instead of temporary system changes or organizational modifications, future receptivity is an underlying element for newcomers to overcome lingering short-termism and facilitate the coordination of stakeholders concerning foresight. In conclusion, we suggest ways to promote future receptivity for newcomers. First, the government should educate and train the public and government officials to promote future literacy and future proficiency. Second, the government should provide a process for public participation such as nationwide networking that enables the public to influence their diverse future images over foresight outcomes.},

Strategic options, futurity of policies and potential futures must be elaborated and kept in sight when developing policies. Anticipatory governance and strategic foresight activities are elements of such an adaptive governance mode. To transform decision-making in a future-oriented way, these forward-planning elements need to be institutionalised to support governance resilience.

This special issue builds on the 2021 Policy and Society special issue on the governance of AI by focusing on the legal, organizational, political, regulatory, and social challenges of governing generative AI. This introductory article lays the foundation for understanding generative AI and underscores its key risks, including hallucination, jailbreaking, data training and validation issues, sensitive information leakage, opacity, control challenges, and design and implementation risks. It then examines the governance challenges of generative AI, such as data governance, intellectual property concerns, bias amplification, privacy violations, misinformation, fraud, societal impacts, power imbalances, limited public engagement, public sector challenges, and the need for international cooperation. The article then highlights a comprehensive framework to govern generative AI, emphasizing the need for adaptive, participatory, and proactive approaches. The articles in this special issue stress the urgency of developing innovative and inclusive approaches to ensure that generative AI development is aligned with societal values. They explore the need for adaptation of data governance and intellectual property laws, propose a complexity-based approach for responsible governance, analyze how the dominance of Big Tech is exacerbated by generative AI developments and how this affects policy processes, highlight the shortcomings of technocratic governance and the need for broader stakeholder participation, propose new regulatory frameworks informed by AI safety research and learning from other industries, and highlight the societal impacts of generative AI.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to lay a theoretical basis for discussion of the ways by which organized foresight can be employed in the service of pro‐poor objectives. This is in line with the fundamental mandate of the Rockefeller Foundation, dating from its establishment. Design/methodology/approach – The objective was to capture concepts that the author has been developing and teaching under the heading of “Forward engagement”. Forward engagement is a particular approach to anticipatory governance, drawing upon complexity theory for assessment of issues requiring government policy; network theory for proposed reforms to legacy systems of governance to enable them to manage complexity under conditions of accelerating change; and cybernetic theory to propose feedback systems to allow ongoing measurement of the performance of policies against expectations. For more detail, visit www.forwardengagement.org. Findings – The paper sketches out some core elements of a system for anticipatory governance. Originality/value – In addition to the primary findings of forward engagement (see web site), this paper argues that foresight and anticipatory concepts can play a vital role, not only for governance in the United States, but for governance in developing countries: perhaps even more so, because such countries have narrower margins for response to significant changes of circumstance.},

	abstract = {Anticipatory governance is ‘a broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety of inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible’. It motivates activities designed to build capacities in foresight, engagement, and integration – as well as through their production ensemble. These capacities encourage and support the reflection of scientists, engineers, policy makers, and other publics on their roles in new technologies. This article reviews the early history of the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the United States, and it further explicates anticipatory governance through exploring the genealogy of the term and addressing a set of critiques found in the literature. These critiques involve skepticism of three proximities of anticipatory governance: to its object, nanotechnology, which is a relatively indistinct one; to the public, which remains almost utterly naïve toward nanotechnology; and to technoscience itself, which allegedly renders anticipatory governance complicit in its hubris. The article concludes that the changing venues and the amplification within them of the still, small voices of folks previously excluded from offering constructive visions of futures afforded by anticipatory governance may not be complete solutions to our woes in governing technology, but they certainly can contribute to bending the long arc of technoscience more toward humane ends.},

Understanding the trajectory, evolution and dominant characteristics of cyberconflict studies is vital for scholars and policy-makers alike. By means of a thorough analysis of articles from the 125 top political science and International Relations journals, we illuminate the field's conceptual and methodological landscape. Our findings uncover a notable Europeanization of the field and a shift towards more rigorous methodologies, particularly experimental designs. While early research focused primarily on conceptual development and strategic topics, the contemporary field of studies exhibits a broader scope and greater diversity of scholarship. While the field has progressed beyond its nascent stages, it has yet to reach its full potential. We address several potential issues facing its growth and relevance. Firstly, there is a lack of global representation among researchers and in the incidents studied. Secondly, embracing interdisciplinary approaches is crucial for addressing newly emerging issues effectively. Thirdly, the diversification of research identities within the field of cyberconflict studies in the US and Europe must be bridged to foster collaboration and exchange of ideas. To overcome these challenges, adopting a pragmatic middle-ground approach is essential.},

	abstract = {Governing emerging technologies is one of the most important issues of the twenty-first century, and primarily concerns the public, private, and social initiatives that can shape the adoption and responsible development of digital technologies. This study surveys the emerging landscape of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) governance and maps the ecosystem of emerging platforms within industry and public and civil society. We identify the major players in the public, private, and civil society organizations and their underlying motivations, and examine the divergence and convergence of these motivation and the way they are likely to shape the future governance of these emerging technologies. There is a broad consensus that these technologies represent the present and future of economic growth, but they also pose significant risks to society. Indeed, there is also considerable confusion and disagreement among the major players about navigating the delicate balance between promoting these innovations and mitigating the risks they pose. While some in the industry are calling for self-regulation, others are calling for strong laws and state regulation to monitor these technologies. These disagreements, are likely to remain for the foreseeable future and may derail the optimal development of governance ecosystems across jurisdictions. Therefore, we propose that players should consider erecting new safeguards and using existing frameworks to protect consumers and society from the harms and dangers of these technologies. For instance, through re-examining existing legal and institutional arrangements to check whether these cater for emerging issues with new technologies, and as needed make necessary update/amendments. Further, there may be cases where existing legal and regulated systems are completely outdated and can't cover for new technologies, for example, when AI is used to influence political outcomes, or crypto currency frauds, or AI-powered autonomous vehicles, such cases call of agile governance regimes. This is important because different players in government, industry, and civil are still coming to terms with the governance challenges that these emerging technologies pose to society, and no one has a clear answer on optimal way to promote these technologies, at the same time limit the dangers they pose to users.},

	abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) policy has begun to take shape in recent years, policy actors have worked to influence policymakers by strategically promoting issue frames that define the problems and solutions policymakers should attend to. Three such issue frames are especially prominent, surrounding AI’s economic, geopolitical, and ethical dimensions. Relatedly, while technology policy is traditionally expert-dominated, new governance paradigms are encouraging increased public participation along with heightened attention to social and ethical dimensions of technology. This study aims to provide insight into whether members of the public and the issue frames they employ shape—or fail to shape—policymaker agendas, particularly for highly contested and technical policy domains. To assess this question, the study draws on a dataset of approximately five million Twitter messages from members of the public related to AI, as well as corresponding AI messages from the 115th and 116th US Congresses. After using text analysis techniques to identify the prevalence of issue frames, the study applies autoregressive integrated moving average and vector autoregression modeling to determine whether issue frames used by the public appear to influence the subsequent messaging used by federal US policymakers. Results indicate that the public does lead policymaker attention to AI generally. However, the public does not have a special role in shaping attention to ethical implications of AI, as public influence occurs only when the public discusses AI’s economic dimensions. Overall, the results suggest that calls for public engagement in AI policy may be underrealized and potentially circumscribed by strategic considerations.},

	abstract = {The liberal international order, erected after the Cold War, was crumbling by 2019. It was flawed from the start and thus destined to fail. The spread of liberal democracy around the globe—essential for building that order—faced strong resistance because of nationalism, which emphasizes self-determination. Some targeted states also resisted U.S. efforts to promote liberal democracy for security-related reasons. Additionally, problems arose because a liberal order calls for states to delegate substantial decisionmaking authority to international institutions and to allow refugees and immigrants to move easily across borders. Modern nation-states privilege sovereignty and national identity, however, which guarantees trouble when institutions become powerful and borders porous. Furthermore, the hyperglobalization that is integral to the liberal order creates economic problems among the lower and middle classes within the liberal democracies, fueling a backlash against that order. Finally, the liberal order accelerated China's rise, which helped transform the system from unipolar to multipolar. A liberal international order is possible only in unipolarity. The new multipolar world will feature three realist orders: a thin international order that facilitates cooperation, and two bounded orders—one dominated by China, the other by the United States—poised for waging security competition between them.},

	abstract = {Technology has always played a central role in international politics; it shapes the ways states fight during wartime and compete during peacetime. Today, rapid advancements have contributed to a widespread sense that the world is again on the precipice of a new technological era.

Emerging technologies have inspired much speculative commentary, but academic scholarship can improve the discussion with disciplined theory-building and rigorous empirics. This book aims to contribute to the debate by exploring the role of technology – both military and non-military – in shaping international security. Specifically, the contributors to this edited volume aim to generate new theoretical insights into the relationship between technology and strategic stability, test them with sound empirical methods, and derive their implications for the coming technological age.

This book is very novel in its approach. It covers a wide range of technologies, both old and new, rather than emphasizing a single technology. Furthermore, this volume looks at how new technologies might affect the broader dynamics of the international system rather than limiting the focus to a stability. The contributions to this volume walk readers through the likely effects of emerging technologies at each phase of the conflict process. The chapters begin with competition in peacetime, move to deterrence and coercion, and then explore the dynamics of crises, the outbreak of conflict, and war escalation in an environment of emerging technologies.

	abstract = {Militaries with state-of-the-art information technology sometimes bog down in confusing conflicts. To understand why, it is important to understand the micro-foundations of military power in the information age, and this is exactly what Jon R. Lindsay's Information Technology and Military Power gives us. As Lindsay shows, digital systems now mediate almost every effort to gather, store, display, analyze, and communicate information in military organizations. He highlights how personnel now struggle with their own information systems as much as with the enemy.Throughout this foray into networked technology in military operations, we see how information practice―the ways in which practitioners use technology in actual operations―shapes the effectiveness of military performance. The quality of information practice depends on the interaction between strategic problems and organizational solutions. Information Technology and Military Power explores information practice through a series of detailed historical cases and ethnographic studies of military organizations at war. Lindsay explains why the US military, despite all its technological advantages, has struggled for so long in unconventional conflicts against weaker adversaries. This same perspective suggests that the US retains important advantages against advanced competitors like China that are less prepared to cope with the complexity of information systems in wartime. Lindsay argues convincingly that a better understanding of how personnel actually use technology can inform the design of command and control, improve the net assessment of military power, and promote reforms to improve military performance. Warfighting problems and technical solutions keep on changing, but information practice is always stuck in between.},

	abstract = {Emerging technologies are increasingly portrayed as having disruptive effects in security and defence, both in civilian and military environments. Yet, while revolutionary military technologies have always been connected to the notion of permanent techno-scientific innovation, there remains ample room for a critical enquiry on what it means to be disruptive in security and defence technology, the effects of claiming disruption and the broader socio-political contexts within which disruptive technology emerges. In this regard, the article draws theoretical insights from critical security studies, science and technology studies, and innovation studies, to propose a new analytical framework to study disruptive security and defence technologies along three analytical axes: temporality, performativity, and imagination. The notion of disruption implies a pre-existing linear, temporal dimension that is meant to be disrupted, and the mere claim of disruption is a performative act that can – although not always – trigger, enable or enact pre-imagined socio-technical futures. As the notion of disruption becomes prevalent in both civilian and military environments, the article contributes to unpacking its constitutive elements and to give it a more central position in contemporary IR debates.},

Combining political theory and empirical case studies, this volume addresses key issues related to protection and the governance of insecurity in the contemporary world. The contributors track the transformation and evolution of critical infrastructures (and closely related issues of homeland security) into a security problem, and analyze how practices associated with CIP constitute, and are an expression of, changing notions of security and insecurity. The book explores aspects of ‘securitisation’ as well as at practices, audiences, and contexts that enable and constrain the production of the specific form of governmentality that CIP exemplifies. It also explores the rationalities at play, the effects of these security practices, and the implications for our understanding of security and politics today.},

	abstract = {The Second Quantum Revolution facilitates the engineering of new classes of sensors, communication technologies, and computers with unprecedented capabilities. Supply chains for quantum technologies are emerging, some focussed on commercially available components for enabling technologies and/or quantum-technologies research infrastructures, others with already higher technology-readiness levels, near to the market. In 2018, the European Commission has launched its large-scale and long-term Quantum Flagship research initiative to support and foster the creation and development of a competitive European quantum technologies industry, as well as the consolidation and expansion of leadership and excellence in European quantum technology research. One of the measures to achieve an accelerated development and uptake has been identified by the Quantum Flagship in its Strategic Research Agenda: the promotion of coordinated, dedicated standardisation and certification efforts. Standardisation is indeed of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of new technologies, and the development of efficient and effective supply chains. The harmonisation of technologies, methodologies, and interfaces enables interoperable products, innovation, and competition, all leading to structuring and hence growth of markets. As quantum technologies are maturing, time has come to start thinking about further standardisation needs. This article presents insights on standardisation for quantum technologies from the perspective of the CEN-CENELEC Focus Group on Quantum Technologies (FGQT), which was established in June 2020 to coordinate and support the development of standards relevant for European industry and research.},

While most cybersecurity professionals acknowledge its importance, many believe their organizations could improve CTI sharing, highlighting ongoing challenges in translating recognition into practice. CTI sharing remains one of the most complex and underdeveloped areas of cybersecurity strategy, with challenges that extend far beyond the technology realm, exacerbated by the absence of a universally accepted definition of CTI, incompatible platforms, and multiple interpretations of trust related to sharing. Theoretical frameworks such as the economics of information exchange and human-to-technology trust that work well for explaining other forms of information sharing, fall short in comprehensively explaining the challenges of CTI sharing. This perspective calls for an expanded research agenda to uncover the underlying barriers to and enablers of CTI sharing. We highlight the unique nature of CTI, where the fusion of raw threat data with human insight distinguishes it from other forms of information exchange, complicating traditional models of data sharing. We develop our perspective beyond existing paradigms, informed by our theoretical repertoires and insights from forty interviewed cybersecurity professionals, to propose a structured approach toward evaluating CTI sharing. We conclude by presenting a conceptual framework that identifies ten factors shaping CTI sharing outcomes and offer a research agenda to advance the CTI sharing research and practice.},

Practitioners lack the ability to properly assess cyber risk, and decision-makers continue to be paralyzed by vulnerability scanners that overload their staff with mountains of scan results. In order to cope, firms prioritize vulnerability remediation using crude heuristics and limited data, though they are still too often breached by known vulnerabilities for which patches have existed for months or years. And so, the key challenge firms face is trying to identify a remediation strategy that best balances two competing forces. On one hand, it could attempt to patch all vulnerabilities on its network. While this would provide the greatest ‘coverage’ of vulnerabilities patched, it would inefficiently consume resources by fixing low-risk vulnerabilities. On the other hand, patching a few high-risk vulnerabilities would be highly ‘efficient’, but may leave the firm exposed to many other high-risk vulnerabilities. Using a large collection of multiple datasets together with machine learning techniques, we construct a series of vulnerability remediation strategies and compare how each perform in regard to trading off coverage and efficiency. We expand and improve upon the small body of literature that uses predictions of ‘published exploits’, by instead using ‘exploits in the wild’ as our outcome variable. We implement the machine learning models by classifying vulnerabilities according to high- and low-risk, where we consider high-risk vulnerabilities to be those that have been exploited in actual firm networks.},

            Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) provides the gold standard for secure key exchange. Not only does it allow for information-theoretic security based on quantum mechanics, but it also relaxes the need to physically model the devices, thereby fundamentally ruling out many quantum hacking threats to which non-DI QKD systems are vulnerable. In practice though, DI-QKD is very challenging. It relies on the loophole-free violation of a Bell inequality, a task that requires high quality entanglement to be distributed between distant parties and close to perfect quantum measurements, which is hardly achievable with current technology. Notwithstanding, recent theoretical and experimental efforts have led to proof-of-principle DI-QKD implementations. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art of DI-QKD by highlighting its main theoretical and experimental achievements, discussing recent proof-of-principle demonstrations, and emphasizing the existing challenges in the field.},

Meanwhile, attacks against IoT devices have emerged to compromise IoT devices by tampering with system pre-installed programs or injecting new malware. To mitigate these attacks, integrity enforcement of IoT systems has been proposed. The integrity of an IoT device system includes load-time integrity and runtime integrity. In this paper, we design an IoT system based on ARM TrustZone to enforce the system integrity. First, we establish the root of trust and propose a hybrid booting approach consisting of both secure boot and trusted boot to enforce the system load-time integrity. Second, we investigate a paging-based process integrity measurement method to measure the NW processes and conduct remote attestation based on the measurement results ensuring the NW runtime process integrity. We implement an IoT prototype system on a NXP i.MX6Q SABRE SD development board to assess its feasibility. Real-world experiment results demonstrate that our prototype introduces negligible performance overhead to the original system.},

In this paper, a dynamic modelling method is used to study the spreading behaviors of ransomware. The dynamic state of each network node is assumed to be statistically dependent of the states of its neighboring nodes. By incorporating the full topology of the propagating network via its adjacent matrix, a novel node-based model is developed which is also suitable over generic connected networks. The dynamics of the model is theoretically analyzed. Especially, the global stability of its trivial equilibrium is theoretically confirmed depending on a sufficient condition including the leading eigenvalue of the adjacent matrix. We also present results from extensive numerical simulations designed for some specific networks, exhibiting different dynamic properties over distinct networks. Consequently, we suggest that ransomware spreading can be availably contained by properly adjusting the network structure so that its largest eigenvalue satisfies the desired requirement.},

	abstract = {Many argue that telecommunications network infrastructure is the most impressive and important technology ever developed. Analyzing the telecom market’s constantly evolving trends, research directions, infrastructure, and vital needs, Telecommunication Networks responds with revolutionized engineering strategies to optimize network construction. Omnipresent in society, telecom networks integrate a wide range of technologies. These include quantum field theory for the study of optical amplifiers, software architectures for network control, abstract algebra required to design error correction codes, and network, thermal, and mechanical modeling for equipment platform design.Illustrating how and why network developers make technical decisions, this book takes a practical engineering approach to systematically assess the network as a whole—from transmission to switching. Emphasizing a uniform bibliography and description of standards, it explores existing technical developments and the potential for projected alternative architectural paths, based on current market indicators. The author characterizes new device and equipment advances not just as quality improvements, but as specific responses to particular technical market necessities. Analyzing design problems to identify potential links and commonalities between different parts of the system, the book addresses interdependence of these elements and their individual influence on network evolution. It also considers power consumption and real estate, which sometimes outweigh engineering performance data in determining a product’s success.To clarify the potential and limitations of each presented technology and system analysis, the book includes quantitative data inspired by real products and prototypes. Whenever possible, it applies mathematical modeling to present measured data, enabling the reader to apply demonstrated concepts in real-world situations. Covering everything from high-level architectural elements to more basic component physics, its focus is to solve a problem from different perspectives, and bridge descriptions of well-consolidated solutions with newer research trends.},

	abstract = {In just three decades the Internet has grown from a small experimental research network into a complex network of routers, switches, and hosts. Understanding the topology of such large scale networks is essential to the procurement of good architectural design decisions, particularly with respect to address allocation and distribution schemes.A number of techniques for IPv4 network topology already exist. Of these ICMP-based probing has shown to be most useful in determining router-level topologies of public networks. However, many of these techniques cannot be readily applied to IPv6 because of changes in the addressing scheme and ICMP behaviour. Furthermore, increases in the proliferation of equal-cost multi-path routing, and other forms of transient routing, indicate that traditional traceroute-based topology discovery approaches are becoming less effective in the Internet.This paper presents Atlas, a system that faciliates the automated capture of IPv6 network topology information from a single probing host. It describes the Atlas infrastructure and its data collection processes and discusses IPv6 network phenomena that must to be taken into account by the probing scheme. We also present some initial results from our probing of the 6Bone, currently the largest public IPv6 network. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the probing algorithm and also identify some trends in prefix allocation and routing policy.},

Although this timely subject has been studied in the cybersecurity literature to a significant degree, so far, no work provides a comprehensive survey regarding the identification of LM from mainly an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) viewpoint. To cover this noticeable gap, this work provides a systematic, holistic overview of the topic, not neglecting new communication paradigms, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The survey part, spanning a time window of eight years and 53 articles, is split into three focus areas, namely, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) schemes, machine learning oriented solutions, and graph-based strategies. On top of that, we bring to light interrelations, mapping the progress in this field over time, and offer key observations that may propel LM research forward.},

	abstract = {Lateral Movement (LM) attacks continue to pose a significant threat to enterprise security, enabling adversaries to stealthily compromise critical assets. However, the development and evaluation of LM detection systems are impeded by the absence of realistic, well-labeled datasets. To address this gap, we propose LMDG, a reproducible and extensible framework for generating high-fidelity LM datasets. LMDG automates benign activity generation, multi-stage attack execution, and comprehensive labeling of system and network logs, dramatically reducing manual effort and enabling scalable dataset creation. A central contribution of LMDG is Process Tree Labeling, a novel agent-based technique that traces all malicious activity back to its origin with high precision. Unlike prior methods such as Injection Timing or Behavioral Profiling, Process Tree Labeling enables accurate, step-wise labeling of malicious log entries, correlating each with a specific attack step and MITRE ATT{\textbackslash}\&CK TTPs. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to support fine-grained labeling of multi-step attacks, providing critical context for detection models such as attack path reconstruction. We used LMDG to generate a 25-day dataset within a 25-VM enterprise environment containing 22 user accounts. The dataset includes 944 GB of host and network logs and embeds 35 multi-stage LM attacks, with malicious events comprising less than 1\% of total activity, reflecting a realistic benign-to-malicious ratio for evaluating detection systems. LMDG-generated datasets improve upon existing ones by offering diverse LM attacks, up-to-date attack patterns, longer attack timeframes, comprehensive data sources, realistic network architectures, and more accurate labeling.},

We address potential endogeneity biases and find the results to remain unchanged. Furthermore, our results are robust to alternative proxies, truncation issues, and external cybersecurity risk. We uncover the mechanisms underlying the main result by showing that the effects are more pronounced for firms with lower tolerance to risk and lower cash savings.

            Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) provides the gold standard for secure key exchange. Not only does it allow for information-theoretic security based on quantum mechanics, but it also relaxes the need to physically model the devices, thereby fundamentally ruling out many quantum hacking threats to which non-DI QKD systems are vulnerable. In practice though, DI-QKD is very challenging. It relies on the loophole-free violation of a Bell inequality, a task that requires high quality entanglement to be distributed between distant parties and close to perfect quantum measurements, which is hardly achievable with current technology. Notwithstanding, recent theoretical and experimental efforts have led to proof-of-principle DI-QKD implementations. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art of DI-QKD by highlighting its main theoretical and experimental achievements, discussing recent proof-of-principle demonstrations, and emphasizing the existing challenges in the field.},

We analyze these use cases, assess their security and identify the possible advantages of deploying QKD-based solutions. We further compare QKD-based solutions with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), the alternative approach to achieving security when quantum computers compromise traditional public-key cryptosystems, evaluating their respective suitability for each scenario. Based on this comparative analysis, we critically discuss and comment on which use cases QKD is suited for, considering factors such as implementation complexity, scalability, and long-term security.

A quantum internet will connect first-generation quantum computers over secure quantum channels to provide and distribute at scale a new type of compute resource that promises better security and a significant speedup of compute power. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The US and China consider emerging technologies in general, and quantum internet technologies in particular, of utmost importance in their efforts to contain their strategic rival. This thesis investigates how the quantum internet is being framed in security terms in this aggravating rivalry, and what this means for the future of the internet. As warnings of the dangers of a fragmented internet increase, the thesis maps out the significant obstacles on the way to maintaining interoperability.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}In an original contribution to research methods, this thesis is the first application of ERGMs to the analysis of patent data and their citation trees in the domain of quantum internet technologies. It conducts a statistical analysis of 4,200 patent family records and the 10,000+ patents they cite. Following a mixed-method approach, this thesis also evaluates a corpus of interviews with GCHQ, the British government and several internet governance and China experts. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}It finds robust evidence for two separate and siloed quantum research programmes in the US and China. These programmes are further characterised internally by significant homophily and the preferential treatment of domestic industries. Findings further suggest a tentative edge for China in the domain of quantum communication, an important technology for realising the quantum internet. China's significant progress in developing components for a quantum internet is found to have great potential to give its increasingly assertive stance on internet governance additional momentum.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The thesis argues that China should be expected to try and offer what may be called 'quantum patronage': a complete package of quantum technology stacks and appropriate standards in line with its recent 'China Standards 2035' plan. Quantum patronage may offer hitherto non-aligned countries critical technologies to secure their communication and build up quantum compute resources in exchange for a commitment to allegiance and strategic alignment.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The empirical findings of this thesis inform the building blocks of a coalitional game theory model of standards-finding for the quantum internet. It recommends the US make side payments to China as compensation for easing its strategic ambitions, in particular around its `New IP' many-nets proposal. The model is a first step towards designing a mechanism for finding a global standard for the future quantum internet. If the fragmentation of the quantum internet is to be avoided, the US and its allies should be prepared to incur new and unexpected political and financial costs to ensure long-term interoperability. Given the empirical evidence that this thesis presents, which points towards fragmentation, this could be a price worth paying for an open quantum internet.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}},

We show that a higher inclination towards “we-mode” reasoning is beneficial overall and maximizes individual payoffs and the outcome for the entire group. We argue that cooperation is therefore in the rational self-interest of stakeholders; it is not just desirable from a vague moral perspective.
