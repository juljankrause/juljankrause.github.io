I work at the boundary where **computer science meets international security**. I translate between formal/technical debates (quantum, cloud, AI, security properties, internet technologies) and policy realities (competition, sovereignty, governance, national security). Empirically, I map who builds emerging critical infrastructure — and what that implies for power, control, and risk.

My research programme follows emerging infrastructure from design to geopolitics:

- **Quantum security, as it actually works**: threat models, attack surfaces, failure modes, and the security claims that survive contact with reality.  
- **The quantum internet and control**: privacy-enhancing promises alongside the real institutional builders: cloud platforms, states, and standards ecosystems.  
- **Competing over the future**: how states use emerging technologies as instruments of status, sovereignty, and strategic narrative.

I back these arguments with **network-based empirical methods** (ecosystem mapping, institutional networks, inferential models) and policy-facing outputs that make technical dynamics legible to decision-makers.

**Book project:** *Qubits & Conflicts* — The Geopolitics of the Quantum Internet (working title).  
**Teaching (Spring 2026):** *INTA4050: International Affairs and Technology Policy Making.* (Georgia Tech).  
**Contact:** email / office details forthcoming.
