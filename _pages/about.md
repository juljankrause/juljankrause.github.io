I work at the boundary where **computer science meets international security**. I translate between formal/technical debates (quantum, cloud, AI, security properties, internet technologies) and policy realities (competition, sovereignty, governance, national security). Empirically, I map who builds emerging critical infrastructure — and what that implies for power, control, and risk.

**Now:** quantum security “in the wild”; **Qubits & Conflicts** (my book project on the geopolitics of the quantum internet); and network methods for tracing emerging-tech ecosystems.

**Keywords:** Quantum • Infrastructure • Security Governance


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
