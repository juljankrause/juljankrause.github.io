I translate between formal/technical debates (quantum, cloud, AI, security properties, internet technologies) and policy realities (competition, sovereignty, governance, national security). Empirically, I map who builds emerging critical infrastructure, and what that implies for power, control, and risk.</p> <p>My research programme follows emerging infrastructure from design to geopolitics:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Quantum security, as it actually works</strong>: threat models, attack surfaces, failure modes, and the security claims that survive contact with reality.</li> <li> <strong>The quantum internet and control</strong>: privacy-enhancing promises alongside the real institutional builders: cloud platforms, states, and standards ecosystems.</li> <li> <strong>Competing over the future</strong>: how states use emerging technologies as instruments of status, sovereignty, and strategic narrative.</li> </ul> <p>I back these arguments with <strong>network-based empirical methods</strong> (ecosystem mapping, institutional networks, inferential models) and policy-facing outputs that make technical dynamics legible to decision-makers.</p> <p><strong>Book project:</strong> <em>Qubits &amp; Conflicts</em> — The Geopolitics of the Quantum Internet (working title).<br> <strong>Teaching (Spring 2026):</strong> <em>INTA4050: International Affairs and Technology Policy Making.</em> (Georgia Tech).<br> <strong>Contact:</strong> email / office details forthcoming.</p> </body></html>
